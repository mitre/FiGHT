FGT5012.006: NAS exploit
Architecture Segment: 
----------------------------------------
Procedure Examples
----------------------------------------
Replay of NAS message: Adversary eavesdrops one NAS message from the legitimate network (the Auth_Req (R, AUTN), or the NAS Security Mode Command (SMC)), then replays that NAS message whenever it wants to check whether the victim UE is nearby, since the type of error (or response, in the case of SMC) received from the responder indicates whether it's the victim UE or not. Thus, adversary can probe for UE’s presence in a that cell, which leads to coarse location data. See [1].
----------------------------------------
Mitigations
----------------------------------------
----------------------------------------
Pre-Conditions
----------------------------------------
Control of fake gNB in the area where the victim UE may be located.: Adversary must install a fake gNB that it can control what messages it sends to UEs.
Control of fake UE  in the NAS SMC attack.: Adversary must acquire a fake UE to achieve the NAS SMC attack.
----------------------------------------
Critical Assets
----------------------------------------
UE location: UE/Subscriber geographical location, coarse or fine-grained
----------------------------------------
Detection
----------------------------------------
FGDS5002: Operator standard means to detect presence of fake gNBs. gNB radio signals (sent to all UEs to enable them to select gNB and connect) are received and reported by UEs to the operator, who can then run cross checks with the signals that the UEs should have received if all gNBs nearby were legitimate.
