FGT5018.001: Cabling and junction boxes
Architecture Segment:   PHYS & Env
----------------------------------------
Procedure Examples
----------------------------------------
Disrupt service via physical damage: An adversary may damage cabling and junction boxes
----------------------------------------
Mitigations
----------------------------------------
 FGM5005: Compliance with cable standards.
Raceway / conduit is one of the easiest ways to protect any cable, fiber optic included. These hollow pieces of plastic act like a protective outer shell.
FGM5005: Implement physical and environmental controls.
Sites should be provided with a full set of physical and environmental controls aimed to assure access control, monitoring, continuity of operations and protection against environmental disasters
FGM5540: Power supply facilities in the isolated area such as mobile base stations should preferably provide an uninterruptible power supply with capacity for all loading and capable of withstanding primary power supply failures for the duration of likely outages. If that is impossible, a mechanism to provide uninterruptible power to critical equipment should be installed. Batteries may need to be augmented with a private electric generator, especially in isolated areas.
----------------------------------------
Pre-Conditions
----------------------------------------
Unprotected cables: Fibers routed between pieces of equipment without proper protection are susceptible to damage, which can critically affect network reliability. The fiber cable management system should therefore ensure that every fiber is protected from physical damage.
 Unprotected junction boxes: Lack of protection of junction boxes / splice closures. Improper cable routing also causes increased congestion in the termination panel and the cableways, increasing the possibility of bend radius violations and long-term failure.
----------------------------------------
Critical Assets
----------------------------------------
Data cables: Data cables used in the operator network infrastructure
Power cables: Power cables used in the operator network infrastructure
----------------------------------------
Detection
----------------------------------------
FGDS5012: Security Incident and event monitoring
Event logs recording user activities, exceptions, faults and information security events should be produced, kept and regularly reviewed. Additional considerations: development of use-case specific alert rules, integration and correlation of data at all levels (network, application), integration and correlation with service provider-level monitoring mechanisms.
----------------------------------------
Post-Conditions
----------------------------------------
Service unavailability: Destruction or damage of these assets may cause an unavailability of resources.
Information destruction: Destruction or damage of these assets may cause information destruction
