FGT5029: Exploit Semi-public Facing Application
Architecture Segment:   Roaming
----------------------------------------
Procedure Examples
----------------------------------------
----------------------------------------
Mitigations
----------------------------------------
M1050: Use of a Web Application Firewall may only allow properly formatted service communication.
FGM5010: Redeploy SEPP regularly to prevent dwell time aka use non-persistence
M1051: Aggressive patching may reduce window of vulnerability if a known vulnerability
----------------------------------------
Pre-Conditions
----------------------------------------
Vulnerability Identified: Adversary must have identified a vulnerability susceptible to the specially crafted message that results in an ability to use additional techniques.
----------------------------------------
Critical Assets
----------------------------------------
SEPP: Security Edge Protection Proxy
AMF: Access & Mobility Management Function
UPF: User Plane Function
----------------------------------------
Detection
----------------------------------------
DS0015: Monitor application logs for evidence of unexpected access requests or potential pattern of errors logged that might indicate attempts to create unexpected behavior
DS0028: Monitor login session logs for evidence an adversary has created accounts or setup access after compromise of the service via specially formed packets on the service API
DS0029: Observe unusual traffic to the SEPP and any evidence of unusual source or destinations from the SEPP that might indicate a source of specially formed packets.
----------------------------------------
Post-Conditions
