FGT5019.002: Intercept Bid-Down IMSI
Architecture Segment:  RAN
----------------------------------------
Procedure Examples
----------------------------------------
Obtain permanent UE identifier IMSI from bid-down UE: Adversary with fake or compromised base station sends an Identity Request message to the UE to get back the IMSI. This occurs after the UE has been bid down from 5G.
----------------------------------------
Mitigations
----------------------------------------
FGM5006: Restrictive user security profile can dictate that the UE will refuse to networks that are not 5G. The prevention of bidding-down is achieved via user security profile stored in the UE.
----------------------------------------
Pre-Conditions
----------------------------------------
Permissive user security profile: User security profile must allow bidding down.
Bid down operation successful: Denying service to 5G and bidding down (e.g. from a fake or compromised base station) must have occurred for this 5G UE.
----------------------------------------
Critical Assets
----------------------------------------
UE identifier: Unique and non-transient user identity
----------------------------------------
Detection
----------------------------------------
FGDS5010: UE transitions to less secure service
----------------------------------------
Post-Conditions
----------------------------------------
Target association: Allows an adversary to identify UE as target of interest for geolocation, degradation of service, loss of traffic confidentiality, or physical attack.
