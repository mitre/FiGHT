T1599.501: Malicious co-tenancy  exploit of NFVI (Network Slice)
Architecture Segment:  Arch-Slice, Impl-CSP
----------------------------------------
Procedure Examples
----------------------------------------
Create Malicious Co-Tenancy: A legitimate tenant 1 uses the Os-ma-nfvo interface to read the NS information of another tenant 2 sharing the NFVO. The tenant 1 may get sensitive information on the NS topology for a NS of a competitor (tenant 2).
Consume on-boarding resources: A malicious tenant on-boards unused NS/VNF just to consume on-boarding resources (e.g. fill the NS and VNF registries or software image repository) to limit the space available for other tenant.
Manipulate network slices of another tenant: A malicious tenant uses the Os-ma-nfvo interface to manage the NSs of another tenant. For example, this malicious tenant may scale down the NS of a competitor to get more resources for his own NS or scale up to increase resource cost of another tenant.
----------------------------------------
Mitigations
----------------------------------------
M1026: Least Privilege Access Control Policy - Access control policies should be granular to allow for optimal access to service requirements.
M1035: Resource Policy enforcement -Create and enforce resource policy; policy can include SLA, quotas, QOS etc.
M1030: Security and Trust zones -Security and trust zones can help isolate resources and can be mapped to business needs.
Micro and Nano segmentation- Implementing segmentation policy at granular level, network and compute resources can prevent some co-residency threats when mapped to SLAs, Users, and Resource policies.

Physical separation- Hardware, network, and point of presence can be separated to provide additional isolation.
FGM5505: Hardware Mediated Execution Environment -Employ secure, hardware- based execution integrity as part of host/server design
M1041: Encryption can be used to protect data at rest and in transit
FGM5506: Use of Network Slice Templates -Use of templates for network slicing can enforce baseline security and isolation requirements.  These templates can be created for networks, compute and 5G slice functions deployments.

Pre-Conditions
----------------------------------------
----------------------------------------
Critical Assets
----------------------------------------
NFVI: NFVI includes orchestrators, network managers, and network elements
VNFs: 5G Core, RAN and NON-SBI functions, virtual resources supporting VNF
Slice Control and User Plane data: Network slice SLA data, some information may be exposed if application functions are shared
VNF application data, VNF sensitive parameters,: 
VNF Lawful Interception data,: 
----------------------------------------
Detection
----------------------------------------
DS0028: Audit Policy Violations - Automated user and resource policy compliance checks and instrumentation to alert on violation attempts
DS0015: Audit logs - Auditing logs for security, authentication and authorization activity, host access, hosts, virtualization orchestrator and managers can reveal behavioral anomalies
DS0013: Monitor systems performance
DS0029: Monitor network flows
