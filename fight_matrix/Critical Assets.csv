T1555.501,Hardware Security Module Key Signing,HSM,"A hardware security module (HSM) is a physical computing device that safeguards and manages digital keys, performs encryption and decryption functions for digital signatures, strong authentication and other cryptographic functions. These modules traditionally come in the form of a plug-in card or an external device that attaches directly to a computer or network  - server. A hardware security module contains one or more secure crypto-processor chips. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_security_module"
