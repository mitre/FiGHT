M1024,Restrict Registry Permissions,Restrict the ability to modify certain hives or keys in the Windows Registry.
M1025,Privileged Process Integrity,"Protect processes with high privileges that can be used to interact with critical system components through use of protected process light, anti-process injection defenses, or other process integrity enforcement measures."
M1026,Privileged Account Management,"Manage the creation, modification, use, and permissions associated to privileged accounts, including SYSTEM and root."
M1027,Password Policies,Set and enforce secure password policies for accounts.
M1028,Operating System Configuration,Make configuration changes related to the operating system or a common feature of the operating system that result in system hardening against techniques.
M1029,Remote Data Storage,Use remote security log and sensitive file storage where access can be controlled better to prevent exposure of intrusion detection log data or sensitive information.
M1030,Network Segmentation,"Architect sections of the network to isolate critical systems, functions, or resources. Use physical and logical segmentation to prevent access to potentially sensitive systems and information. Use a DMZ to contain any internet-facing services that should not be exposed from the internal network. Configure separate virtual private cloud (VPC) instances to isolate critical cloud systems."
M1031,Network Intrusion Prevention,Use intrusion detection signatures to block traffic at network boundaries.
M1032,Multi-factor Authentication,Use two or more pieces of evidence to authenticate to a system; such as username and password in addition to a token from a physical smart card or token generator.
M1033,Limit Software Installation,Block users or groups from installing unapproved software.
M1034,Limit Hardware Installation,"Block users or groups from installing or using unapproved hardware on systems, including USB devices."
M1035,Limit Access to Resource Over Network,"Prevent access to file shares, remote access to systems, unnecessary services. Mechanisms to limit access may include use of network concentrators, RDP gateways, etc."
M1036,Account Use Policies,"Configure features related to account use like login attempt lockouts, specific login times, etc."
M1037,Filter Network Traffic,Use network appliances to filter ingress or egress traffic and perform protocol-based filtering. Configure software on endpoints to filter network traffic.
M1038,Execution Prevention,"Block execution of code on a system through application control, and/or script blocking."
M1039,Environment Variable Permissions,Prevent modification of environment variables by unauthorized users and groups.
M1040,Behavior Prevention on Endpoint,"Use capabilities to prevent suspicious behavior patterns from occurring on endpoint systems. This could include suspicious process, file, API call, etc. behavior."
M1041,Encrypt Sensitive Information,Protect sensitive information with strong encryption.
M1042,Disable or Remove Feature or Program,Remove or deny access to unnecessary and potentially vulnerable software to prevent abuse by adversaries.
M1043,Credential Access Protection,Use capabilities to prevent successful credential access by adversaries; including blocking forms of credential dumping.
M1044,Restrict Library Loading,Prevent abuse of library loading mechanisms in the operating system and software to load untrusted code by configuring appropriate library loading mechanisms and investigating potential vulnerable software.
M1045,Code Signing,Enforce binary and application integrity with digital signature verification to prevent untrusted code from executing.
M1046,Boot Integrity,Use secure methods to boot a system and verify the integrity of the operating system and loading mechanisms.
M1047,Audit,"Perform audits or scans of systems, permissions, insecure software, insecure configurations, etc. to identify potential weaknesses."
M1048,Application Isolation and Sandboxing,Restrict execution of code to a virtual environment on or in transit to an endpoint system.
M1049,Antivirus/Antimalware,Use signatures or heuristics to detect malicious software.
M1050,Exploit Protection,Use capabilities to detect and block conditions that may lead to or be indicative of a software exploit occurring.
M1051,Update Software,Perform regular software updates to mitigate exploitation risk.
M1052,User Account Control,Configure Windows User Account Control to mitigate risk of adversaries obtaining elevated process access.
M1053,Data Backup,Take and store data backups from end user systems and critical servers. Ensure backup and storage systems are hardened and kept separate from the corporate network to prevent compromise.
M1054,Software Configuration,Implement configuration changes to software (other than the operating system) to mitigate security risks associated to how the software operates.
M1055,Do Not Mitigate,This category is to associate techniques that mitigation might increase risk of compromise and therefore mitigation is not recommended.
M1056,Pre-compromise,"This category is used for any applicable mitigation activities that apply to techniques occurring before an adversary gains Initial Access, such as Reconnaissance and Resource Development techniques."
M1057,Data Loss Prevention,"Use a data loss prevention (DLP) strategy to categorize sensitive data, identify data formats indicative of personal identifiable information (PII), and restrict exfiltration of sensitive data."
FGM5001,Disable malicious transmitter,Detect and locate jammer with special equipment. Disable malicious transmitter.
FGM5002,,
FGM5004,,
FGM1498,Limit incoming signaling traffic,Use a firewall or other rate limiter for signaling traffic coming into 5G network
FGM5027,Verify legitimate use of access token,Chcek if the slice using access token is authorized to use the token
FGM1557,Integrity protection of data communication,Use strong data integrity protection algorithms
FGM5033,Zero Trust,Use zero trust principles for application/NF protection
FGM1195,Secure file transfer,Securely transfer sensitive files between two end points
FGM5019,Authorize external API calls,NEF should authorize API calls especially from external AFs for service accesses
FGM5003,Cross check between application layer and transport layer,NFs such as NRF should cross check with TLS layer before issuing token to an NF
FGM1499,Rate limiting by producer NF,Producer NF e.g. AUSF can rate limit authentication requests from the same SUCI too many times in a short period
FGM5012,Slice ID check,Check if IMSI is served by the slice ID (NSSAI)
FGM5012,Allocate new 5G-GUTI,Network should allocate new 5G-GUTI whenever possible

FGM5011,Non-Persistent Connectivity,Connections are terminated after completion of a request or after a period of non-use.
FGM5099,Move UE close to gNB,Move UE close to gNB or indoors to make geo-location harder
