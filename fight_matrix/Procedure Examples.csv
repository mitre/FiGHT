T1195.501,SIM credential theft,Agency (GHCQ) infiltrated SIM vendor’s (Gemalto) network.,Allegedly: GHCQ planted malware on Gemalto servers to obtain SIM credentials. The number of keys are in the order of millions. [1]
T1018,Core-network scanning,"Tools exist for pen testing. Examples GTScan, SigPloit, SCTPScan and GTPScan.",
FGT5007,Registration of malicious network functions,API used is Nnrf_NFManagement,"Adversary uses this API to register one of these functions: AMF, SMF, UDM, AUSF, NEF, PCF, SMSF, NSSF, UPF, etc. Clause 5.2.7 of [3]"
FGT5012.005,Shared network function in slice,"Malicious NF belonging to compromised Slice gets an access token for the target AMF, which servers both target slice and compromised slice.","Malicious NF of a compromised slice gets access token for a shared AMF, but then asks AMF for the location of a UE in the target slice. The AMF checks that the authorization (OAuth) token is ok, which it is, but does not check that the UE ID is served by target slice, while the requester NF is from compromised slice."
FGT5001,Exploitation of Interconnect Edge Application Programming Interfaces,Denial of Service,The SEPP can be overloaded with API calls if it does not apply rate limiting.
FGT5001,Exploitation of Interconnect Edge Application Programming Interfaces,Sensitive data exposure,"Adversary uses an insecure API to take over the edge NF, then can use legitimate signaling to obtain sensitive UE or network data."
T1592.501,Internal resource search,IR.21 accessible from the Internet,"Claro Americas, and Vivo telecom, had in 2016 their IR.21 database accessible from an internet  (links [2], [3] no longer accessible)"
FGT5006.002,Billing Evasion,"Passive Identity Mapping Attack – Check ATT&CK, this might have addendums. (Network Sniffing, Technique T1040 - Enterprise | MITRE ATT&CK®). Both passive attacks are probably T040. Send email to Dr. Michaela to ask if these two attacks are already present and if they should be an addendum to T1040 or possibly sub techniques to something else.","Passive attack. Match transient radio identities to more permanent network identities, identifying users in the cell and preparing the battlefield for follow on attacks."
FGT5006.002,Billing Evasion,Unmask User Web Activities - this might have addendums. See comment in previous line.,"Passive attack. Abuse the resource allocation as
a side channel to perform website fingerprinting that enables
the attacker to learn the websites a user accessed."
T1557.506,Air Interface,Adversary-in-the-Middle on air interface for a given UE,"The adversary employs a back to back gNB-UE combination. When UE security profile allows bidding down, adversary denies service to 5G, bids down victim UE to less secure protocol with illegitimate signaling, acts as a man-in-the-middle to intercept and possibly modify communication, and relays communication to and from intended recipient."
T1557.506,Air Interface,Adversary-in-the-Middle on air interface for any UE,"Alternatively, if the 5G system employs null integrity or encryption, user data traffic can be eavesdropped or modified in transit over the air interface"
FGT5018,Vandalism of network infrastructure,"Communication center: unauthorized access, destruction of assets and impairment of operations",
FGT5018,Vandalism of network infrastructure,"Telecommunications equipment room:  unauthorized access, destruction of assets and impairment of operations.",
FGT5018,Vandalism of network infrastructure,"Physically isolated operation areas: unauthorized access, destruction of assets and impairment of operations",
FGT5018,Vandalism of network infrastructure,"Equipment sited in other carrier's or partner's premises: unauthorized access, destruction of assets and impairment of operations.",
T1557.501,Bid down UE,Fake gNB with stronger signal strength than legitimate gNBs sends RRC redirection that is not integrity protected.,UEs tend to attach to gNBs which have better signal condition than the gNB the UE is currently attached.
FGT5019.001,Intercept Home Network via SUCI,Intercept home network over the air.,"Receive SUCI and extract home network, which is never concealed."
