            "description": "FiGHT™ (5G Hierarchy of Threats), is a knowledge base of adversary Tactics and Techniques for 5G systems. FiGHT™ consists of three types of Techniques: theoretical, proof of concept (PoC), and observed. The theoretical and PoC constitute the bulk of the framework and are based upon academic research and other publicly available documents. Currently, a minority of FiGHT™ Techniques are based upon real-world observations, documented accordingly. Each FiGHT™ Technique is labelled as theoretical, PoC, or observed.",
