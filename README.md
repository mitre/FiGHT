# ATLAS

MITRE ATLAS (Adversarial Threat Landscape for Artificial-Intelligence Systems), is a knowledge base of adversary tactics, techniques, and case studies for machine learning (ML) systems based on real-world observations, demonstrations from ML red teams and security groups, and the state of the possible from academic research.

ATLAS is modeled after the MITRE ATT&CKÂ® framework and its tactics and techniques are complementary to those in ATT&CK.  Machine learning is increasingly used across a variety of industries and there are a growing number of vulnerabilities.  We developed ATLAS to raise awareness of these threats and present them in a way familiar to security researchers.
