# FiGHT

FiGHT™ (5G Hierarchy of Threats), is a knowledge base of adversary Tactics and Techniques for 5G systems. FiGHT™ consists of three types of Techniques: theoretical, proof of concept (PoC), and observed. The theoretical and PoC constitute the bulk of the framework and are based upon academic research and other publicly available documents. Currently, a minority of FiGHT™ Techniques are based upon real-world observations, documented accordingly. Each FiGHT™ Technique is labelled as theoretical, PoC, or observed.

FiGHT™ serves as a foundation to 5G security research and can be operationalized in various ways, such as to conduct threat assessments, enable adversarial emulation, identify coverage gaps, and inform cyber investment planning. As 5G continues to expand and intersects with technologies globally, adversaries will leverage the increased attack surface to exploit and disrupt the use of 5G. MITRE hopes that through the use of FiGHT™, 5G stakeholders can work together to ensure a secure and resilient 5G ecosystem.

FiGHT™ is modeled after the MITRE ATT&CK® framework, and its tactics and techniques are complementary to those in ATT&CK. This early, beta release of FiGHT™ is being offered to the public in order to solicit feedback from the relevant communities of telecommunication providers, manufacturers, and cyber security researchers.
