| description          | An adversary can divert user plane traffic for one or more UEs via a user-plane function, to monitor user data.Traffic diversion is a threat relating to network elements of the user plane. A compromised or misconfigured NF (as documented in the procedures below: UPF, SMF, …) is used to send or cause to send a command to a user plane (routing) function that results in altering the traffic flow. This threat involves compromising a network element to divert traffic flows and allow a malicious actor to eavesdrop on user traffic. Redirection attacks on the core network result in not only communication interception, but also in billing discrepancies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | This technique is missing from the file                                                                                                                                            |

It is also expected that 5G services to end consumer may include third party services to support resources required by 5G Core and RAN elements such as third party back haul	 MEC or commercial Cloud data centers resources.  Adversary may use a software or hardware supply chain to insert compromised components (binaries	 FW	 compromised processing chips) in the supply chain of a targeted MNO or taint entire supply chain first to have option to select a target from victims receiving compromised products.  Opensource communities may be vulnerable to accidental or intentional compromise.  These days a lot of reputable vendors also use open-source components in their license products	 Opensource community can offer a conduit to a target victim.\r\n\r\n | #### Addendum Name: _5G_Supply_Chain_Compromise\r\n##### Architecture Segments: OA&M	 Virtualization	 RAN	 O-RAN\r\n Adversaries may manipulate products or product delivery mechanisms prior to deployment in an MNO’s production environment for the purpose of data or system compromise.\r\n\r\n5G deployments are expected to have various deployment models comprise of vendor supplied VNF/CNFs	 open-source software	 and dedicated physical appliances from suppliers as well as white label hardware.

These days a lot of reputable vendors also use open-source components in their license products	 Opensource community may become a conduit to a target victim.\r\n\r\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| addendums            | #### Addendum Name: 5G Orchestration and Deployment Tools\r\n##### Architecture Segments: OA&M	 Virtualization	 RAN	 UE\r\n An adversary may use CI/CD tools to gain access to production hosts/VNFs for discovery	 data exfiltration and for deployment of lateral movements tools.  \r\n\r\nIn 5G deployments	 MNO’s development and deployment tools offer a conduit to 5G production RAN and Core network functions.

The fronthaul interface makes it possible to distribute the physical layer functionalities between RU and DU	 and to control RU operations from DU. ORAN Alliance has selected a specific configuration (split 7.2x) for splitting of the physical layer among those proposed by 3GPP. The lower part of the physical layer (low PHY) resides in RU and performs Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) phase compensation	 inverse FFT and Cyclic Prefix (CP) insertion for frequency-to-time conversion in downlink	 and FFT and CP removal in uplink. The physical layer in DU (high PHY) performs scrambling	 modulation	 layer mapping	 and resource element mapping. Fronthaul consists of four types of interfaces: Control or C plane is used to carry control plane messages	 User or U plane is used to carry user plane data	 Synchronization or S plane is used to carry timing information and Management or M plane is used to carry management data.\r\n\r\nO-RAN fronthaul interface needs to implement strict performance requirements which includes very high throughput and very low latency. See clause 4.4 of [2]. Some security features may not be implemented by MNOs to meet those requirements and to reduce processing delay. Hence	 Adversary on the Side (AoTS) attack on open fronthaul interface is possible which results in passive eavesdropping of U plane data. The adversary may use a simple sniffer device to monitor all U plane communications which is normally not encrypted at lower 3 layers (RLC	 MAC and PHY). Confidentiality and integrity protection requirements are not specified by ORAN alliance for control	 user and synchronization (CUS) planes	 and those are mandatory for M plane. See clause 6.1 of [2] and clause 5.4 of [3].\r\n\r\nNote: The user plane data in PDCP and above layers remains encrypted on Fronthaul U plane and this eavesdrop attack will not impact any of those data unless PDCP security is also broken by the adversary.\r\n\r\n |

SBI: Encrypt using TLS all links between NFs and between NF and SCP if one is deployed. TLS must use certificates for both client and server, and the certificate must include the SBA node type and must be checked against what the expectation is for that other party. The TLS profile should adhere to those in TS 33.210 [9]. IPSec can be optionally used to protect TLS traffic further at a lower layer. Section 13.1.0 of [2] and also [8], [9].

| description   | An adversary may send high volumes of registration signaling to degrade performance or deny access to the network for all UEs.Upon power on or coming out of flight mode, a UE needs to register with 5G network in order to get services from the network. After it gets connected to the network, UE sends several signaling messages to maintain the connection and to request new services. If any of those signaling messages are sent repeatedly to 5G network, the network spends its resources to process those request messages, which may overwhelm some critical Network Functions (NFs) such as Access and Mobility Function (AMF).A malicious UE sends repeated Attach requests which cause AMF to start many registrations. Alternatively, when a load balancing Service Communication Proxy (SCP) is not employed, an adversary in the network sends many otherwise-legitimate control messages to a NF so as to overload it. Network service is degraded for all other users in that area (served by AMF). | An adversary-controlled UE may send high volumes of signaling messages to core network functions in order to cause a denial of service.Upon power on or coming out of flight mode, a UE needs to register with 5G network in order to get services from the network.

This attack assumes a successful Bid down UE attack or else the network uses no (“NULL”) encryption on the radio interface.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | An adversary may eavesdrop on unencrypted sensitive subscriber data on the air interface to capture information and to fingerprint application layer usage pattern of victim UE.An adversary may employ a back-to-back fake gNB-UE combination to eavesdrop on the communication and relay communication between the intended recipient and the intended source, over the radio interface. This attack assumes a successful bid down UE attack or else the network uses no (“NULL”) encryption on the radio interface.LTE layer 2 RLC/MAC metadata (e.g. PDCP packet length) may be eavesdropped by adversary on the air interface as all layer 2 data below PDCP layer are sent without encryption in LTE. Once the metadata is collected, an Artificial Intelligence/Machine learning (AI/ML) tool can be used to track which websites the UE applications are using even though PDCP and higher layer data are encrypted. The adversary must be in the same area where the victim UE is located to sniff the downlink air link messages sent to UE from gNB. The same attack is possible in 5G as layer 2 protocols have not changed in the 5G 3GPP specification.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

An example of application layer obfuscation is to use Orbot as Tor proxy that sends and receives all traffic through a Tor circuit. This is not highly effective as some metadata can still be used to fingerprint applications.

Encryption of metadata such as PDCP length can be done to prevent this attack. It introduces large overhead on UE and hence it is not proposed in the 3GPP [6].<br><b>name</b>	Use obfuscation at application layer                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

If the gNB does not provide confidentiality or integrity protection for control plane and user plane packets on the non-SBI interfaces, then an AITM attack is possible. Note that the Non-Access Stratum (NAS) packets sent on the N2 interface from the UE to the core function AMF are already integrity/confidentiality protected. However, unlike radio communications, operator RAN to core communications are not always employing the confidentiality or integrity protection mandated by 3GPP standards. | An adversary with access to Non-Service Based Interfaces (Non-SBI) network nodes (including routers/switches/load balancers) may position themselves in order to support follow-on behaviors such as [Network Sniffing](/techniques/FGT1040) or [Transmitted Data Manipulation](/techniques/FGT1565.002).“Non-SBI” network interfaces are within the Radio Access Network (RAN) (e.g. Xn, F1, E1) and core (e.g. N4), and between the RAN and the 5G Core (e.g. N2, N3 interfaces).

Note that the Non-Access Stratum (NAS) packets sent on the N2 interface from the UE to the core function AMF are already integrity/confidentiality protected.

| description          | Adversaries may alter data en route to storage or other systems in order to manipulate external outcomes or hide activity.(Citation: FireEye APT38 Oct 2018)(Citation: DOJ Lazarus Sony 2018) By manipulating transmitted data, adversaries may attempt to affect a business process, organizational understanding, and decision making.Manipulation may be possible over a network

Refer clause 4.3.1 of [3].\r\n\r\n	 #### Addendum Name: Radio Interface\r\n##### Architecture Segments: O-RAN\r\n Adversary with access to radio interface manipulates user and control plane traffic received on that interface without integrity protection	 for example to redirect traffic	 or obtain location information of the UE.\r\n\r\nIf the gNB does not provide integrity for control plane or user plane packets on radio interfaces	 then data manipulation (alteration of data frame content	 insertion/spoofing of messages	 or replay of old messages) is possible. \r\n\r\n	 #### Addendum Name: _Fronthaul_User_Plane_Data\r\n##### Architecture Segments: O-RAN\r\n Adversary manipulates User Plane data on Fronthaul interface between O-DU and O-RU to re-direct the data to a wrong destination or get discarded by the recipient due to incorrect message parameters.\r\n\r\nORAN Alliance has defined the open fronthaul interface which connects one O-DU to one or more O-RUs inside the gNB. The fronthaul interface makes it possible to distribute the physical layer functionalities between RU and DU	 and to control RU operations from DU. ORAN Alliance has selected a specific configuration (split 7.2x) for splitting the physical layer among those proposed by 3GPP. The lower part of the physical layer (low PHY) resides in RU and performs Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) phase compensation	 inverse FFT and Cyclic Prefix (CP) insertion for frequency-to-time conversion in downlink	 and FFT and CP removal in uplink. The physical layer in DU (high PHY) performs scrambling	 modulation	 layer mapping	 and resource element mapping. Fronthaul consists of four types of interfaces: Control or C plane is used to carry control plane messages	 User or U plane is used to carry user plane data	 Synchronization or S plane is used to carry timing information and Management or M plane is used to carry management data.\r\n\r\nO-RAN fronthaul interface needs to implement strict performance requirements which includes very high throughput and very low latency. See clause 4.4 of [2]. Some security features may not be implemented by MNOs to meet those requirements and to reduce processing delay. Hence	 AiTM attack on open fronthaul interface is possible which results in manipulation of U plane data. The adversary may manipulate RLC and MAC layers of the user plane data to cause DoS attack and/or session redirection attack (e.g. DNS redirection) on legitimate subscribers. Confidentiality and integrity protection requirements are not specified by ORAN alliance for control	 user and synchronization (CUS) planes	 and those are mandatory for M plane. See clause 6.1 of [2] and clause 5.4 of [3].\r\n\r\nNote: The user plane data in PDCP and above layers remains integrity protected on Fronthaul U plane and this data manipulation attack will not impact any of those data unless PDCP security is also broken by the adversary.\r\n\r\n |

| description | An adversary in the 5G core who has compromised a proxy or middlebox may position themselves between Network Functions (NFs) that are communicating via the Service Based Interfaces (SBI), in order to support follow-on behaviors such as  [Network Sniffing](/techniques/FGT1040) or [Transmitted Data Manipulation](/techniques/FGT1565.002).SBI network interfaces are between core NFs within an operator network. An adversary may compromise a proxy on the SBI, such as the Service Communication Proxy (SCP), API proxy, or a load-balancer. Then an adversary may also exploit improper TLS configuration (including weaker cipher, profile) of the SBI connections, which may arise for example due to the use of TLS profiles forbidden in 3GPP TS 33.310 for NF mutual authentication and NF transport layer protection. | An adversary in the 5G core who compromised a proxy or middlebox may position themselves between Network Functions (NFs) that are communicating via the Service Based Interfaces (SBI), in order to support follow-on behaviors such as  [Network Sniffing](/techniques/FGT1040) or [Transmitted Data Manipulation](/techniques/FGT1565.002).SBI network interfaces are between core NFs within an operator network.

| description   | An adversary may query CDR databases in the mobile network to collect communications metadata.An adversary may compromise the N40 interface between CHF and SMF/SMSF in order to get detailed communication data. An adversary may collect CDRs from mobile networks by using malware. Note: In earlier generations of 3GPP networks, CDRs are generated on switches, and then moved to billing servers.                                                                                             | Adversary may compromise the 5G Charging Function (CHF) in order to steal sensitive subscriber call related data/CDRs.Adversary may compromise 5G CHF by either cloning a legitimate CHF or by implanting malware inside a legitimate 5G CHF in order to steal subscriber’s call and SMS related metadata. The information may be used to enable follow-on privacy attacks such as tracking internet usage and call/SMS activities of certain subscribers.In earlier generations of 3GPP networks, CDRs are generated on switches, and then moved to billing servers. In 5G, Converged Charging System (CCS) is responsible for generating CDRs for subscribers based on their data usage. CHF is part of the CCS. CHF communicates to other core NFs via Service Based Interface (SBI). It receives data usage information from core NFs such as SMF. The CDRs are processed by charging data processing functions external to the 5G network – that is, by the Offline Charging System (OFCS) for postpaid customers and by the Online Charging System (OCS) for prepaid customers. |

| description          | An adversary may compromise an xApp to affect the radio network configuration.The O-RAN architecture includes the Radio Intelligence Controllers (RICs), which consists of the Non-Real-Time Radio Intelligent Controller (Non-RT RIC) and the Near-Real-Time Radio Intelligent Controller (Near-RT RIC), to optimize radio resource management of gNB components. The Non-RT RIC is embedded in the Service and Management Orchestration (SMO) framework and hosts rApps to provide policy-based guidance, machine learning model management and enrichment information to the Near-RT RIC function for the purpose of RAN optimization. The Near-RT RIC is a logical function that hosts xApps and enables near real-time control and optimization of the functions and resources of gNB components O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP and O-DU, steered via the policies and enrichment data provided from the Non-RT RIC.xApps are applications designed to run on the Near-RT RIC to provide the desired RAN functionality. xApps are independent of the Near-RT RIC and may be provided by any third party. xApps on the Near-RT RIC can collect near real-time information from gNB components (O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP and O-DU) and influence behavior of those components thereby impacting 5G base station performance and delivery of services to a group of UEs or a single UE.A compromise of an xApp (or through xApp Agent) can potentially lead to unauthorized changes in a CU or DU via E2 Interface. | An adversary may compromise an xApp to affect the radio network configuration.The O-RAN architecture includes the RAN Intelligence Controllers (RIC), which consists of the Non-Real-Time RAN Intelligent Controller (Non-RT RIC) and the Near-Real-Time RAN Intelligent Controller (Near-RT RIC), to optimize radio resource management of gNB components. The Non-RT RIC is embedded in the Service Management and Orchestration (SMO) framework and hosts rApps to provide policy-based guidance, machine learning model management and enrichment information to the Near-RT RIC function for the purpose of RAN optimization. The Near-RT RIC is a logical function that hosts xApps and enables near-real-time control and optimization of the functions and resources of gNB components [O-RAN Central Unit-Control Plane (O-CU-CP), O-RAN Central Unit-User Plane (O-CU-UP) and O-RAN Distributed Unit (O-DU)], steered via the policies and enrichment data provided from the Non-RT RIC. The O-RAN platform can perform both non-real-time optimization and near-real-time optimization of O-RAN elements through the Non-RT RIC and Near-RT RIC. Non-real-time optimization may be used for higher-level optimization and is facilitated by the Non-RT RIC. Use cases such as policy-based guidance and AI/ML are examples of those appropriate for non real-time-optimization. Near-real-time optimization enables certain capabilities and is facilitated by the Near-RT RIC. Use cases such as radio resource management and Quality of Service (QoS) optimization are examples of those appropriate for near-real-time optimization. xApps are applications designed to run on the Near-RT RIC to provide the desired RAN functionality. xApps are independent of the Near-RT RIC and may be provided by any third party. xApps on the Near-RT RIC can collect near-real-time information from gNB components (O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP and O-DU) and influence behavior of those components, thereby impacting 5G base station performance and delivery of services to a group of UEs or a single UE.xApps may be compromised during the delivery to the service provider, either through the external supply chain from vendor to the service provider or through the internal CI/CD pipeline. Malicious code may be inserted in the xApp application package that could compromise the application.

| description          | An adversary may compromise an rApp to affect the radio network configuration.O-RAN architecture includes the Radio Intelligence Controllers (RICs), which consists of the Non-Real-Time Radio Intelligent Controller (Non-RT RIC) and the Near-Real-Time Intelligent Controller (Near-RT RIC), to optimize radio resource management of gNB components. The Non-RT RIC is embedded in the Service and Management Orchestration (SMO) framework and hosts rApps to provide policy-based guidance, machine learning model management and enrichment information to the Near-RT RIC function for the purpose of RAN optimization. The Near-RT RIC is a logical function that hosts xApps and enables near real-time control and optimization of the functions and resources of gNB components O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP and O-DU, steered via the policies and enrichment data provided from the Non-RT RIC.rApps are applications that use the functionalities in the Non-RT RIC Framework to provide value added services related to RAN operation and optimization.A compromise of an rApp (or through rApp Agent) can potentially lead to unauthorized changes in O-CU or O-DU via A1 interface from Non-RT RIC to Near-RT RIC. | An adversary may compromise an rApp to affect the radio network configuration.O-RAN architecture includes the RAN Intelligence Controllers (RICs), which consists of the Non-Real-Time RAN Intelligent Controller (Non-RT RIC) and the Near-Real-Time RAN Intelligent Controller (Near-RT RIC), to optimize radio resource management of gNB components.

Malicious code may be inserted in the rApp application package that could compromise the application. Adversary may also obtain rApp credentials or compromise a 3rd party infrastructure the application is hosted on.A compromise of an rApp (or through rApp Agent) can potentially lead to unauthorized changes in O-CU or O-DU via A1 interface. |

| addendums        | #### Addendum Name: Exploit Public-Facing Network Function\r\n##### Architecture Segments: Control Plane	 User Plane\r\n An adversary may exploit weaknesses in Application Programming (API) interfaces on Network Functions (NF) that are exposed to the public Internet	 which exposes those functions to compromise of the NF	 or disclosure of information. \r\n\r\nSome 5G functions such as the Network Exposure Function (NEF) have APIs that are public facing and are subject to potential exploit by adversaries similarly to public facing websites and services. The adversary could exploit a previously identified weakness in the API to gain initial access to the operator’s environment.

The adversary could exploit a previously identified weakness in the API to gain initial access to the operator’s environment. The adversary may also obtain credentials through other techniques that allow the adversary to obtain unauthorized information from the exposed network function. See Exploit Semi-public Facing Application [FGT5029](/techniques/FGT5029) for API exposure to interworking networks.\r\n\r\nAn example of this is represented through access control of application functions (AF) by NEF is done at the API level which is not protected at a granular enough level	 i.e.	 it is not done at Information Element (IE) level. An adversary may use a 3rd party AF to make requests for a service	 e.g. location of a UE	 beyond their authorization level since IE’s are not explicitly required to be checked. \r\n\r\n |

| description | An adversary may change the configuration of network nodes so as to disable or weaken integrity protection on the network interfaces Non-SBI, SBI and Roaming, thus allowing for transmitted data manipulation.The following network interfaces are in the scope of this document.1. “Non-SBI” (non-Service Based Interface) network interfaces are within 5G core and RAN, and between the RAN and the 5G Core (e.g. N2, N3, N4, Xn). 2. SBI network interfaces are between core NFs within an operator network; they use REST APIs.3. Roaming and interconnect interfaces, including IPX, are between network operators (between SEPPs (N32), or other interworking functions like AMF/MME (N26) and between the UPFs owned by different network operators (N9)).An adversary with control over gNB or AMF or UPF or SMF may disable IPSec on non-SBI interfaces (Xn, N2, N3, N4). IPSec is expected to be used to protect all non-SBI links, however, unlike radio communications, operator RAN to core communications do not mandate integrity protection.An adversary with access to the SBI links, for example, with control over one or more core network NFs or a middlebox (including the Service Communication Proxy (SCP) if deployed), may disable use of TLS or use older TLS version such as v1.1. TLS is expected (by 3GPP standards) to be used to protect all SBI links within the operator core network. An adversary with control over roaming nodes or interfaces- namely SEPP or IPX network-- may disable or cause to use a weak integrity algorithm for TLS or JWS signatures on the N32 interface. An adversary with control over visited network UPF may disable IPSec on N9 interface or a compromised MME or AMF may disable IPSec on N26 interface. | An adversary may change the configuration of network nodes so as to disable or weaken integrity protection on the network interfaces Non-SBI, SBI and Roaming, thus allowing for transmitted data manipulation.The following network interfaces are in the scope of this document.1. “Non-SBI” (non-Service Based Interface) network interfaces are within 5G core (e.g. N4) and RAN (e.g. Xn, F1, E1), and between the RAN and the 5G Core (e.g. N2, N3). 2.

| description   | An adversary may intercept unencrypted radio transmissions of a UE’s SUCI to identify the IMSI/SUPI of the UE. Adversary can retrieve the IMSI/SUPI of UE if SUCI is sent unencrypted over the air. The adversary can launch other attacks on the subscriber with the IMSI/SUPI. Background information: The UE’s permanent identity, SUPI (SUbscriber Permanent Identifier), includes a home network identifier and a user-specific identifier, and is never sent unencrypted over the radio interface. Instead, a SUCI (SUbscriber Concealed Identifier) is sent when the UE goes through initial registration to the serving network procedures; this de-concealment operation can only be done by the UE’s home network. However, SUCI can be sent unencrypted over the air by UE in any of the following scenarios: 1. When UE makes an emergency call and it does not have a 5G-GUTI  2. If the home PLMN has configured "NULL” SUCI-protection algorithm to be used3. If the home PLMN has not provisioned the public key needed to generate a SUCI.

Adversary can retrieve the IMSI/SUPI of UE if SUCI is sent unencrypted over the air. The adversary can launch other attacks on the subscriber with the IMSI/SUPI. When 5G UE is connected to 4G base station (eNB) in non-stand alone (NSA) mode, adversary uses an airlink signal analyzer to retrieve UE's permanent identity (IMSI/SUPI). All threats present in 4G network including IMSI/SUPI catching can materialize when UE is connected to network via 4G eNB.Background information: The UE’s permanent identity, SUPI (SUbscriber Permanent Identifier), includes a home network identifier and a user-specific identifier, and is never sent unencrypted over the radio interface.

If the home PLMN has not provisioned the public key needed to generate a SUCI Refer clause 6.12.2 of [1].NSA mode uses 4G core, and it uses two types of base stations: 4G & 5G for network access. Depending on the coverage area and network load, MNO chooses whether to connect the UE to the 5G base station (gNB) or to 4G base station (eNB). eNB typically covers a much larger area than gNB. |

| description      | Adversary sends specifically crafted messages from an interconnect/interworking partner against roaming interface to gain access to the service function, e.g., SEPP, or to obtain information from the interworking facing service function.A semi-public application or service is one that is only reachable by an adversary over an interworking network that is typically only exposed to mobile network operators (MNO), internetwork packet exchange providers (IPX), Value Added Services (VAS) providers. An adversary that has previously compromised, through other techniques, another service on the interworking network may be in a position to use this technique against an operator’s interworking facing service interfaces. The adversary does not necessarily need to compromise a roaming partner but needs to be on a network which can reach the target interface.The technique uses specifically formatted signaling messages to cause unexpected behavior that the adversary has previously determined to permit gaining access to the roaming interface system or network functions reachable via SEPP (N32), AMF/MME (N26), or N3IWF interfaces. The specially crafted messages may also permit the collection of information about the targeted operator and its users. The adversary may target the SEPP itself or place specially crafted messages within legitimately authenticated messages that the SEPP passes to NFs that can result in compromise of the NF or information collection. N9 interfaces and non-3GPP interfaces exposed to interworking partners may also be targeted by adversaries. The technique [FGT1190](/techniques/FGT1190) covers internet facing service interfaces. | Adversary sends specifically crafted messages from an interconnect/interworking partner against roaming interface to gain access to the service function, e.g., SEPP, or to obtain information from the interworking facing service function.A semi-public application or service is one that is only reachable by an adversary over an interworking network that is typically only exposed to mobile network operators (MNO), internetwork packet exchange providers (IPX), Value Added Services (VAS) providers.

Consists of numerous methods, including noise jamming, generating false synchronization signals, and replaying modified portions of legitimate signals to degrade demodulation. Jamming in 5G (NR) is different from 3G and similar to 4G, but at high level the same principles are applied. This technique is similar to the ATT&CK for Mobile technique T1464.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| description          | This technique is missing from the file | An adversary may send specially crafted data to the UE over-the-air via the radio interface to execute malicious code.  An adversary with a position to send data to the UE, such as control of an IMS service or the UPF may send data to the UE that can, using a previously identified vulnerability, cause adversary execution on the UE.The adversary may identify a vulnerability in the radio interface through fuzzing techniques against the baseband and supporting chips used in the UE.  Vulnerabilities that could enable an adversary to execute code include heap corruptions and use-after-frees[1].  Additionally, vulnerabilities such as buffer overflow vulnerabilities are often found due to insecure coding practices. Although fuzzing has been demonstrated to be a viable approach to identify vulnerabilities, vulnerabilities may be discovered by adversaries through additional techniques including physical examination/tampering and binary executable analysis. |

| description          | This technique is missing from the file | An adversary may send specially crafted data to the UE's application processor's interface to the baseband API to execute malicious code. The adversary with a position on the UE to communicate to the baseband API can execute malicious code on the baseband processing system.The adversary may identify a vulnerability in the baseband API through fuzzing techniques[1].  Vulnerabilities that could enable an adversary to execute code include memory boundary violations, including buffer overflows that affect the stack and the heap on the baseband.  Vulnerabilities such as buffer overflow vulnerabilities are often found due to insecure coding practices. Although fuzzing has been demonstrated to be a viable approach to identify vulnerabilities, vulnerabilities may be discovered by adversaries through additional techniques including physical examination/tampering and binary executable analysis. |

The adversary may identify a vulnerability in the UE modem and exploit this to execute malicious code. The adversary may need specific knowledge of the modems	 e.g.[T1592.001]( https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1592/001/)	 used in specific UEs and exploits might be viable for specific models of UEs or the class of UE utilizing a specific version of firmware	 e.g. [T1592.003]( https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1592/003/). Vulnerabilities may be discovered in multiple ways and exploiting the vulnerability may require previous use of techniques to obtain an operator RAN position or deploy a false base station	 such as in [FGT1583.501]( https://fight.mitre.org/techniques/FGT1583.501)	  to which the UE would connect.  \r\n |

Creation of a false base station may not be sufficient in a 5G network to further the adversary’s objectives due to security improvements from earlier generations. The availability of open 5G core and RAN software and services make this viable for an adversary. The adversary, controlling the 5G network the UE attaches, via additional techniques, such as [FGT1583.501](https://fight.mitre.org/techniques/FGT1583.501/), may redirect the UE or use [FGT1562.501](https://fight.mitre.org/techniques/FGT1562.501) to perform a downgrade attack to weaken end-to-end security. Techniques such as [FGT5009]( https://fight.mitre.org/techniques/FGT5009/) may also be utilized by the adversary to evade defenses. |

Unlike [T1650 – Acquire Access](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1650), the adversary is not acquiring access through an underground market and the adversary may be part of a legitimate organization that has obtained access.  The adversary, working within the legitimate organization, may then use that legitimately obtained access in unauthorized ways. The adversary may also be acquiring infrastructure access through coercion or subterfuge from a legitimate operator or service provider. The adversary may use this network infrastructure, however obtained, as a position to apply additional follow-on behaviors. |

UPF/PGW forwards the GTP-U packet to gNB/eNB. gNB/eNB decapsulates the GTP-U header and forwards the inner packet to the victim UE. UE responds to the message. The response message is received either by the adversary or by an adversary controlled malicious server on the internet. Thus, adversary establishes a two-way communication to the victim UE. Once the session is established, adversary can launch further attacks such as inserting malware, execute Remote Procedure Call (RPC) etc. |

| description          | This technique is missing from the file                                                                                                                                            | An adversary may discover a valid GTP-U TEID in order to apply additional techniques.The GPRS Tunneling Protocol - User plane (GTP-U) is a protocol in both 4G and 5G that tunnels user data packets between the radio network (gNB/eNB) and the User Plane Function (UPF) in 5G, Serving Gateway (SGW) in 4G. In 4G, there is another GTP-U tunnel between SGW and Packet Data Network (PDN) Gateway (PGW). The GTP-U protocol header has a Tunnel Endpoint ID (TEID). Each UE is assigned a unique TEID for the GTP-U tunnel and it is used to carry data from multiple QoS flows. In order to apply additional techniques like hijacking the tunnel, the adversary needs to discover a valid TEID.Adversary may try to guess the TEID by sending a large number of encapsulated GTP-U packets to the UPF/PGW from the internet with different TEIDs, until a valid one is found. UPF/PGW forwards those packets to the UE through GTP-U tunnels. Following GTP-U tunnels are used: In 5G, N3 GTP-U tunnel between UPF and gNB, in 4G, S1-U GTP-U tunnel between SGW and eNB and S5 GTP-U tunnel between SGW and PGW. When target IP address and TEID match, the adversary may receive a response indicating success. Some core networks show affinity to certain ranges of TEIDs under certain conditions, making brute forcing easier. Once TEID is known, further attacks can be launched to slow down or crash the targeted UE. |

By sending crafted NAS messages from UE, an adversary may force 5G core AMF or other Control Plane functions to go into undefined states, and might result in DoS. UEs use NAS connection (via N1 interface) to the core AMF function. A specially crafted message can be used to cause coding or parsing error which can potentially crash the AMF. Existing UEs and new UEs may not be able to get service from the 5G network. |

It tunnels user data packets from the radio access networks (gNB/eNB) towards data networks (such as the Internet). Other core network functions (NFs) - such as the Session Management Function (SMF) - support the control plane. In this threat, a user plane packet crosses over to the control plane. The UPF/PGW normally processes GTP-U packets to and from the radio access network (gNB/eNB). A GTP-U packet, after the header is stripped, should contain a regular user data IP packet, with the source IP address of the UE, and the destination an external IP address (Internet). However, in this case, it contains a control packet addressed to a core network function for instance the SMF. The UPF/PGW should then drop this packet, but in some implementations it was found that the UPF/PGW may instead route it as indicated.Thus, if UPF/PGW does not do proper parameter checks, it may route the packet to an improper destination such as a core network function in the control plane e.g. SMF, it can cause the NF to go to an undefined state and the NF may crash. |

The IMS is used to provide voice and SMS services; this is accomplished via traditional protocols SS7 and Diameter between the IMS and 5G core functions. This subtechnique covers the abuse of such legitimate signaling to obtain the location of a UE.Background info:5G SA core has interfaces to IMS core to support voice and SMS services. Diameter/SS7 attacks. In signaling plane, voice service uses Diameter based Rx interface between PCF and P-CSCF in IMS, Diameter based Sh interface between HSS/UDM and TAS in IMS, Diameter based Cx interface between HSS/UDM and I/S-CSCF. It also uses SIP/SDP based Gm interface between UPF and P-CSCF in the user plane. SMS over NAS service uses SS7 (MAP) based interface and S6c Diameter based interface from UDM to SMSC. It also uses MAP and SGd (Diameter) interfaces from SMSF to SMSC. |

The IMS is used to provide voice and SMS services; this is accomplished via traditional protocols SS7 and Diameter between the IMS and 5G core functions. This subtechnique covers the abuse of such legitimate signaling to obtain the permanent identifier of a UE. Once the IMSI/SUPI is obtained, adversary may launch further attacks such as retrieving location of the UE, network slice and data network that are being used by the UE etc.  Background info:5G SA core has interfaces to IMS core to support voice and SMS services. Diameter/SS7 attacks. In signaling plane, voice service uses Diameter based Rx interface between PCF and P-CSCF in IMS, Diameter based Sh interface between HSS/UDM and TAS in IMS, Diameter based Cx interface between HSS/UDM and I/S-CSCF. It also uses SIP/SDP based Gm interface between UPF and P-CSCF in the user plane. SMS over NAS service uses SS7 (MAP) based interface and S6c Diameter based interface from UDM to SMSC.

They reside in the Near Real Time (near-RT) RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) after onboarding is done by ORAN orchestration system. Near-RT RICs control and optimize RAN functions for events ranging from 10 ms to 1 sec. xApps manage Radio Resource Management (RRM) functions of RAN via E2 interface. The following components are controlled by xApps by using APIs: E2 nodes such as O-DU, O-RU, O-CU-CP and O-CU-UP. Near-RT RIC and xApps are managed by non-RT RIC via A1 interface for RAN optimizations and by SMO via O1 interface for lifecycle management.During onboarding of xApps, malware may be installed by the adversary in xApps which can gain unauthorized access to near-RT RIC by exploiting weak or misconfigured authentication mechanism in near-RT RIC. A malicious xApp image may be crafted by the adversary and then installed in near-RT RIC during onboarding. A legitimate xApp may be cloned in near-RT RIC by an insider adversary.Once installed in near-RT RIC, the rogue xApp may indirectly access E2 nodes via APIs by penetrating traffic separating firewalls within ORAN. The rogue xApp may change behavior of near-RT RIC which will impact RAN functions such as coverage, network slicing, QoS etc. |

This will cause temporary DoS attack for some users until an alternate connection is available.Mobile IAB nodes are small cell base stations which are typically deployed on a vehicle placed in strategic areas. For example, mIAB node can be deployed near a stadium for a game event. The backhaul traffic from the mIAB node is carried over the air to the next hop base station. The next hop gNB can be another IAB node or a fixed base station (aka donor IAB) which has a wired connection to the 5G core network.An IAB node may use the same or different RF frequency bands for the backhaul traffic to the upstream IAB node and for providing network access to the UEs connected to itself. If the same frequency band is used for backhaul and access, it is known as in-band deployment and if different frequency bands are used for backhaul and access, it is known as out-of-band deployment. The adversary may choose to jam both frequency bands in case of out-of-band deployment to disrupt both backhaul and access communications.The adversary may impact communications of the target IAB node, the IAB nodes that are downstream from the target IAB node and all UEs that are connected to the target IAB node and all UEs that are connected to downstream IAB nodes.

The IMSI Catcher term has been traditionally associated with UE identity discovery or location identification.  Adversary may build one with open-source code and generic radio transceivers. Open-source code for software defined radio	 or RAN test equipment	 or simulators can also be modified to create an IMSI catcher.\r\n\r\n	 #### Addendum Name: _Silent_paging_tool\r\n##### Architecture Segments: RAN	 UE\r\n An adversary may build or develop a silent SMS tool in order to send SMSs to nearby phones in a target area.\r\n\r\nA silent SMS is described in the specification GSM 03.40 as a Short Message of type 0	 which indicates that the UE must acknowledge receipt of the short message but may discard its contents.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to build/develop an application to send silent SMS messages	 which can run on a regular phone (UE) that can register to a local network. That application can be used to send a silent SMS to a target UE using the phone number (MSISDN).\r\n\r\n                                                                   |

This is software that can run on a single piece of hardware. To configure it, the configuration files would need to be updated:  configure PLMN identifiers, radio frequency spectrum, IP addresses for core components. Configuration for connecting to one or more radio access nodes (e.g. base station) may also be done.This technique is to be used in conjunction with the equivalent technique for fake base station FGT1608.501. |

IMSI Catcher terms has been traditionally associated with UE identity discovery or location identification.  Adversary may buy an IMSI Catcher from legitimate vendors selling products.\r\n\r\n	 #### Addendum Name: _Silent_paging_tool\r\n##### Architecture Segments: RAN	 UE\r\n An adversary may buy or steal a silent SMS tool in order to send SMSes to nearby phones in a target area.\r\n\r\nA silent SMS is described in the specification GSM 03.40 as a Short Message of type 0	 which indicates that the UE must acknowledge receipt of the short message but may discard its contents.\r\n\r\nA simple mobile phone running a program to send silent SMSes is such an SMS tool. What is needed is cellular connectivity	 and the phone number of the victim. \r\n\r\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

A UE has a permanent identifier (IMSI or SUPI), but also a temporary one (“Temporary Mobile Subscriber Identity”) assigned by the network (TMSI, with their version for 4G and 5G). Adversaries can take advantage of cellular networks where the IMSI is used when computing how to page a UE, rather than TMSI, or when the TMSI is used but not changed frequently. This is a choice of the mobile network operator. An adversary can send silent SMS messages to that target phone number, and watch the paging messages that the base station in that area sends in response (assumes the target UE is in inactive mode and is located in the area of a base station where the adversary has installed a radio interface sniffer). From the sniffed paging messages, and adversary learns the “paging occasion” for that UE. From the paging occasion, several bits (7) of the IMSI can be deduced. The rest of the IMSI (24 bits) can be tried out by brute force by sending many paging messages (e.g. via a fake base station) corresponding to the IMSIs being tried out, and if one gets a response that is valid, it means that the guess is correct. Several UEs may end up sharing the same paging occasion. With knowledge of the victim’s phone number, an adversary can cause the victim UE to be paged in a certain fashion (e.g. by sending a given number of silent SMS and watching for a similar number of paging messages), the adversary can determine the paging occasion for that UE. If the UE is not located in that cell area, then no such paging messages will be noticed. An adversary needs to install sniffers in all of the cell areas of interest, i.e. where they desire to determine the presence or absence of a target UE at a given time, and/or to determine the UE identifiers (IMSI or SUPI or TMSI).Background information: the IMSI in the US is ~49 bits, but the IMSI’s leading 18-bits (i.e., the mobile country code and the mobile network code) can be obtained from the phone number using paid, Internet-based home location register lookup services. The “paging occasion” – the precise time/frequency slot when the paging indication is sent—is calculated in a known way based on a UE identifier- either IMSI or TMSI. |

These paging messages can be heard by all UEs in the area. The paging message broadcast time/frequency is calculated by the base station based on the temporary identifier 5G-GUTI or 4G-GUTI of the target UE, or the IMSI. It is assumed that the adversary can guess the UEs GUTI (see technique FGT5012.006).An adversary sends multiple paging messages and then sniffs the radio interface looking for UEs’ responses to paging messages. Paging is successful if the target UE responds.  If such a set of multiple paging responses corresponding to the paging calculated from the one given GUTI is noticed, then it can be concluded that that UE is present in the cell area. This leads to discovery of the coarse location of a UE. As a side benefit, a valid GUTI (or several GUTIs) is also now discovered.

Currently ORAN implementation specifies RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) and associated xApps/rApps as part of the RAN system for machine learning and optimization.  Machine learning models may also exist in Service Management and Orchestration (SMO) to optimize network design, deployment and operation.  A nefarious change on ML models or data can cause drastic behavior change of O-RAN components including network outage. Altering a machine learning model (System manipulation and compromise of ML data confidentiality and privacy), adversary can change O-RAN behavior. |

In the context of AI/ML security threats, adversaries can employ various techniques to compromise machine learning models at different stages. During training, they can engage in data poisoning by injecting manipulated data (Data Injection), mislabeling data points (Label Poisoning), or maliciously augmenting data with adversarial samples (Data Augmentation Poisoning). Adversaries can also manipulate the model itself during training, introducing hidden backdoor patterns (Backdoor Attacks) or deducing sensitive information by observing model outputs (Model Inversion Attacks). In the inference phase, they can create adversarial examples to trick the model (Adversarial Examples) or subtly change data distributions over time to cause incorrect predictions (Concept Drift). Additionally, adversaries can engage in data pollution by manipulating live input data (Data Poisoning in Live Systems) or compromise model integrity by stealing and manipulating training data (Data Theft). Lastly, they can attempt to determine training data membership via Membership Inference Attacks by querying the model with tailored inputs. The ORAN implementation outlines the inclusion of a RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) and its associated xApps/rApps within the RAN system, which are designed for machine learning and optimization purposes. Machine learning models might also be present within the Service Management and Orchestration (SMO) framework to enhance network design, deployment, and operation. However, any malicious alterations made to these ML models, or their associated data could lead to unintended consequences, such as disruptions in the desired operational state of network components, traffic management issues, and potentially even network outages. |

This diversity introduces multiple potential points of vulnerability before the software is employed in 5G communication services. An adversary could exploit the supply chain of management and monitoring tools	 network functions	 or infrastructure software	 including operating systems	 orchestration systems	 and element managers. The same software deployment model is used in O-RAN systems	 hence all vulnerabilities described in this addendum applies to O-RAN networks as well.\r\n\r\n" |

This clandestine access can prove challenging to identify	 affording the adversary substantial control over the system. Hardware backdoors have the potential to be introduced into a wide array of devices	 including servers	 workstations	 network infrastructure components	 and peripherals.\r\n\r\n5G multiplicity of deployment options introduces numerous potential points of vulnerability	 all before the hardware even integrates into 5G communication services. Within this complex landscape	 adversaries possess the opportunity to exploit various aspects of the supply chain	 such as compromising management and monitoring tools	 tampering with firmware within components	 or clandestinely introducing additional chips into server and network hardware. Furthermore	 the prospect of counterfeit hardware infiltrating the legitimate supply chain accentuates the vulnerability landscape. Counterfeit hardware may lack rigorous security considerations and thorough testing	 making it a potential Achilles heel within the supply chain. The same hardware or firmware deployment model is used in O-RAN systems	 hence all vulnerabilities described in this addendum applies to O-RAN networks as well.\r\n\r\n" |

The front haul interface plays a crucial role in connecting the DU and the Remote Radio Unit (RU or RRU) within the network	 ensuring efficient communication. \r\n\r\nTo transport the CPRI (Common Public Radio Interface) traffic from the RU to the DU	 an Ethernet-based bridged network is employed. This involves utilizing various Ethernet protocols such as IEEE 802.3 for general Ethernet connectivity	 IEEE 802.1 for bridging and VLAN tagging	 and IEEE 802.1CM for time-sensitive networking in industrial automation. The Ethernet-based fronthaul interface establishes a high-capacity and low-latency connection between the DU and the RU	 facilitating the efficient transmission of digital baseband data	 synchronization signals	 control signals	 and management information. Usually	 RUs and Ethernet Switches are placed near the antenna units	 which are unmanned facilities and can be physically breached due to detection and response time delays by personnel. \r\n\r\nUnauthorized devices on this infrastructure can pose significant risks to the O-RAN network. Such devices can be used towards a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack by sending malicious or bogus messages	 disrupting network operations.

| description          | This technique is missing from the file | An adversary may obtain radio network function needed to attack target victim UEs.Adversary provides an alternate radio access network (gNB or open-RAN gNB components such as Distributed Unit (DU) or Centralized Unit (CU)) to target victim UEs without victim (user or UE) discovering that they are not attached to a legitimate MNO network.  This can be achieved by the adversary obtaining false base station network functionality and any connections to core network functions required to carry out their mission.

It sends fake System Information Block Type 1 (SIB1) messages which are aligned in time-frequency domain with the messages sent by the legitimate eNB, but with stronger transmit power. The adversary does not send synchronization signals (PSS, SSS) for this attack which makes it harder to detect. This is known as sigover attack. [1]Adversary may transmit crafted broadcast messages by manipulating cell barring in Master Information Block (MIB) and access barring feature in SIB1 broadcast messages, UE will stop camping on to legitimate network for 300 seconds and it gets a DoS attack. The same attacks are possible in 5G network as MIB and SIB1 messages in 5G are similar to 4G and those are not integrity protected in 5G. |
