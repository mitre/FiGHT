This is a known flaw in the routing of SMSs from previous generations, so home networks put an 'SMS home router' which intercepts such requests for UE location. HOwever, misconfiguration in this SMS router can leave open the door for smart location query requests to still slip by and reach the home operator location services and thus get the UE location in response.",

For a given sent of UEs, such an AF talks to the NEF (NEtwork exposure function) and asks for the UE location (if subscribed service is location service). An adversary may compromise this AF and use it to ask for the location of a given UE, and if that UE has alllowed it, then it will go undergo the location determination procedure and so the result (its coordinates) will be sent to that AF, where the adversary sits. Alternatively, the AF may be used by an adversary to ask for locations for another UE that is not actually subscibed/has not allowed such location services, and if the NEF is not careful to check the authorization of this AF, it may end up responding to the AF's illegimiate request by providing the location of this victim UE.",
