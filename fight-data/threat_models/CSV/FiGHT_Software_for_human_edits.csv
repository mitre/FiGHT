FGS5001,PingPong,PingPong listens for inbound magic ICMP echo requests and establishes a TCP reverse shell connection to an IP address and port specified at certain offsets within the packet.,"The PingPong implant was used by threat actors LIGHTBASIN and LIMINAL PANDA to listen for a special ""magic"" ICMP echo request, and upon receiving it, establishes a TCP reverse shell to a specified IP address and port within the packet. The shell spawns a /bin/bash process, which masquerades as the legitimate httpd process to avoid detection. The reverse shell typically communicates with a remote server owned by another compromised telecommunications provider, using TCP port 53 (DNS) to disguise the malicious traffic as legitimate DNS communication.","&T1205 Traffic Signaling,

FGS5005,SIGTRANslator,"SIGTRANslator is a Linux ELF binary capable of sending and receiving data via various SS7 over IP protocols, which are used to carry public switched telephone network (PSTN) signaling over IP networks. This signaling data includes valuable metadata such as telephone numbers called by a specific mobile station. Data transmitted to and from SIGTRANslator via these protocols is also sent to a remote C2 host that connects to a port opened by the binary. This allows the remote C2 server to siphon data flowing through the binary and send data to SIGTRANslator from the C2 to be re-sent via a SIGTRAN protocol.","This executable provided LIMINAL PANDA with the ability to transmit data in telecommunication-specific protocols, while monitoring the data being transmitted.

TINYSHELL backdoors were configured to perform communications using TCP over port 53 and 443, likely as a mechanism to bypass outbound network protections, blend in with existing traffic, and evade detection.","T1059 Command and Scripting Interpreter,
