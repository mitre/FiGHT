1.	“Non-SBI” (non-Service Based Interface) network interfaces are within 5G core and RAN, and between the RAN and the 5G Core (e.g. N2, N3, N4, Xn). 

2.	SBI network interfaces are between core NFs within an operator network; they use REST APIs.

3.	Roaming and interconnect interfaces, including IPX, are between network operators (between SEPPs (N32), or other interworking functions like AMF/MME (N26) and between UPFs (N9)).

Unlike radio communications, operator RAN to core communications do not mandate integrity protection. If the gNB does not provide integrity protection for control plane (CP) packets sent on the N2/Xn interface or does not provide user plane (UP) integrity protection for user plane packets sent on the N3/Xn interfaces, or UPF does not provide integrity protection for user plane packets sent on the N9 interface, then data manipulation (alteration of messages, insertion/spoofing of messages, or replay of legitimate signaling messages) is possible. This may result in DOS. 

The adversary with access to the SBI links, for example, with control over a middlebox (not including the Service Communication Proxy or SCP), may manipulate or inject spoofed signaling messages if TLS integrity is not enabled or is using a weak algorithm.
 
If an IPX disables JWS signature or uses a weak algorithm for JWS signature, an AiTM may manipulate data over the N32 interface while a UE is roaming.

(2) As such, there can be multiple instances of a given NF, such as UPF, using a common transport, such as a common EVC on the Back-Haul.
(3) Therefore, multiple slices and multiple instances of a NF can receive data that is on that single transport connection, thus theoretically bleeding unauthorized or secure data to the wrong NF and/or wrong Network Slice.

The NRF, which authorizes functions on the SBA using lower layer TLS or IPSec, does not provide authorization of service access or authorization to access individual sensitive information elements.

Adversary assumes that NFs within a slice are sharing transport with NFs of other slices.  Due to lack of identity mapping between multiple instances of a Network Function and Transport, the adversary exploits the transport to compromise data from multiple slices.  The adversary reads data directed toward the transport (data leaks) and sends data northbound to the slice and other NFs within other slices (sends leaked data to the wrong NF and creates DoS attacks to multiple slices).
