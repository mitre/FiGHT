  description: " An adversary may query the Network Repository Function (NRF) to discover\
    \ restricted Network Function (NF) services to further target that NF. \r\n\r\n\
    All active NFs in an operator network are to be securely registered with the NRF.\
    \ Part of this registration information includes the type of NF, the particular\
    \ services it provides, IP addresses, etc. \r\n\r\nConsumer NFs query the NRF\
    \ for Producers NFs they need to interact with, but the NRF is expected to check\
    \ that the Consumer NF is authorized to discover such Producer NF. This type of\
    \ signaling to the NRF can be abused to identify and target the NF of interest.\
    \ The NRF is expected to check discovery request against senders profile, which\
    \ is prone to misconfiguration and thus might not protect the restricted NF services.\r\
    \n\r\nIn network slicing, the same principles of NRF apply, and the service discovery\
    \ is restricted per slice; however, NFs in one slice may have a legitimate need\
    \ to communicate with NFs in another slice. If NF discovery authorization for\
    \ a specific slice is not supported by the NRF, the NF instance in one slice can\
    \ discover NF instances belonging to other slices. For example, an NF in one slice\

  description: " An adversary in control of an AMF can register it in the UDM to serve\
    \ a victim UE, in order to commit fraud or retrieve subscription data for UEs.\r\
    \n\r\nA UE can be legitimately de-registered or be caused to de-register. The\
    \ UDM is the core network function that holds the current registration status\
    \ and data of an UE. An adversary can exploit an incorrectly implemented UDM that\
    \ does not update the authentication status of a UE upon a de-registration event,\
    \ or the authentication status is incorrect. This flaw allows a malicious AMF\
    \ to register itself in UDM (via Nudm_UECM_Registration Request API call).  An\
    \ adversary controlling an AMF can register that AMF Identifier in the UDM as\
    \ the current AMF which is serving the UE. \r\n\r\nThis technique also applies\
    \ to the SMF and SMSF (SMS Function), not just AMF, using the same API to the\
    \ UDM. \r\n\r\nNote: The references do not specify a next step/ultimate goal of\
    \ this procedure (a 3GPP contribution mentions \u201Cstealing data from the UDM\u201D\
    ; while \u201Cfraud\u201D is hinted at in a GSMA document, so it is imaginable\
    \ that an AMF may claim to serve the roaming UE when in fact it is not.)\r\n\r\
    \nFor an adversary to achieve this, a UDM must be incorrectly implemented.  The\
    \ improperly configured UDM needs to be able to perform all of the basic functions,\
    \ except that it does not mark a UE as de-registered when it powers off or is\
    \ legitimately (or illegitimately) de-registered by the network.\r\n \r\n"

      the UDM implementation does not update the authentication status of UEs as de-registered,
      it will accept that AMF. The adversary-controlled AMF can then potentially perform
      additional hostile actions such as fraud, claiming to have provided services
      (for roaming UEs), or obtaining other UE information from the UDM.

      Note that the UDM does not communicate with the AMF based on OAuth tokens. Since
      AMF to UDM signaling is part of the key UE control plane, it may be that they
      have a permanent TLS connection (TBC)'

  procedureexamples:
  - Description: Adversary eavesdrops one NAS message from the legitimate network
      (the Auth_Req (R, AUTN), or the NAS Security Mode Command (SMC)), then replays
      that NAS message whenever it wants to check whether the victim UE is nearby,
      since the type of error (or response, in the case of SMC) received from the
      responder indicates whether it's the victim UE or not. Thus, adversary can probe
      for UE presence in a that cell, which leads to coarse location data. See [1].
