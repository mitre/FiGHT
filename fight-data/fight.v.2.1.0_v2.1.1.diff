<     ##### Architecture Segments: \r\n An adversary may attach a device to an O-RAN\
<     \ fronthaul infrastructure in order to disrupt its traffic.\r\n\r\nIn an O-RAN\
<     \ architecture, the baseband unit (BBU) is divided into two components: the distributed\
<     \ unit (DU) and the centralized unit (CU). The front haul interface plays a crucial\
<     \ role in connecting the DU and the Remote Radio Unit (RU or RRU) within the network,\
<     \ ensuring efficient communication. \r\n\r\nTo transport the CPRI (Common Public\
<     \ Radio Interface) traffic from the RU to the DU, an Ethernet-based bridged network\
<     \ is employed. This involves utilizing various Ethernet protocols such as IEEE\
<     \ 802.3 for general Ethernet connectivity, IEEE 802.1 for bridging and VLAN tagging,\
<     \ and IEEE 802.1CM for time-sensitive networking in industrial automation. The\
<     \ Ethernet-based fronthaul interface establishes a high-capacity and low-latency\
<     \ connection between the DU and the RU, facilitating the efficient transmission\
<     \ of digital baseband data, synchronization signals, control signals, and management\
<     \ information. Usually, RUs and Ethernet Switches are placed near the antenna\
<     \ units, which are unmanned facilities and can be physically breached due to detection\
<     \ and response time delays by personnel. \r\n\r\nUnauthorized devices on this\
<     \ infrastructure can pose significant risks to the O-RAN network. Such devices\
<     \ can be used towards a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack by sending malicious or\
