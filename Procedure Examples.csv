AMF Message Flooding for a shared slice with shared NFs:
(1) An initial AMF validates if the user (UE) is allowed to access the subscribed S-NSSAI: AMF contacts the UDM to request the UE’s Slice Selection Subscription data.  The initial UDM may contact the UDR for the UE's Slice Selection Subscription data, then provides the data to the AMF.
(2) During the t0 to t-delta time interval that it takes to perform (1), the UE drops the initial AMF then re-attaches to the AMF, restarting the validation.
(3) The UE recursively performs (2), which recursively performs (1), creating a ""UE-AMF-UDM-UDR-AMF"" message storm sandwiched in between an ""Attach-Detach"" storm.
(4) Since this is a shared slice with shared NFs, the control plane storm (Attach-UE-AMF-UDM-UDR-AMF-Detach-Attach-recursively repeat) creates a DoS condition."

The NF asks the NRF for an OAuth token for an NF in that other slice. The reason is the requested SD (actually, the entire NSSAI) is included in the OAuth token without verification whether requester is allowed access to it. The NRF issues that OAuth token because it is for a producer NF that serves both the requester’s slice and the targeted (victim) slice. 
This seems to be a poor approach to access control- one that relies on knowing an identifier, and so access is given if that identifier—presumably kept secret—is found out. See section 3.1.3.1 of [1]."
