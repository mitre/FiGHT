The fronthaul interface makes it possible to distribute the physical layer functionalities between RU and DU, and to control RU operations from DU. ORAN Alliance has selected a specific configuration (split 7.2x) for splitting of the physical layer among those proposed by 3GPP. The lower part of the physical layer (low PHY) resides in RU and performs Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) phase compensation, inverse FFT and Cyclic Prefix (CP) insertion for frequency-to-time conversion in downlink, and FFT and CP removal in uplink. The physical layer in DU (high PHY) performs scrambling, modulation, layer mapping, and resource element mapping. Fronthaul consists of four types of interfaces: Control or C plane is used to carry control plane messages, User or U plane is used to carry user plane data, Synchronization or S plane is used to carry timing information and Management or M plane is used to carry management data.\r\n\r\nO-RAN fronthaul interface needs to implement strict performance requirements which includes very high throughput and very low latency.

These boundaries can also exist between different network components, such as radio access, core, edge, and cloud, as well as between national or international links and operator cores, and service providers or operator cores.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, firewalls may be used to separate these zones, such as SS7 protocol, Diameter protocol, 5G APIs, enhanced SCP (Service Communication Proxy), IP (Internet Protocol), SIP (Session Initiation Protocol), and GTP (GPRS Tunneling Protocols) firewalls. Alternatively, an interworking function may be used to translate one protocol into another. However, it's important to note that privileged access is not always necessary to bypass a firewall or exploit an interworking function.

When these functions are contracted externally, adversaries may compromise them upstream, before the services are delivered to the MNO environment. This enables stealthy, indirect access to the target telecom infrastructure.\r\n\r\nWhen managed service providers (outsourced or contracted services) are used for providing service to customers, the adversary may be in a position to compromise information about the subscriber. These services may include outsourced IT operations, software development, integration and deployments, IP transport, Cloud hosting, helpdesk etc. This technique pertains specifically to external managed service providers (e.g., contracted IT or cloud services) rather than internal enterprise support functions where corporate security rules may be different or not verifiable. \r\n\r\nFor example, threat actors such as Liminal Panda (CrowdStrike, 2024) and Salt Typhoon (Tenable, 2024), state-sponsored actors targeted telecom providers by compromising their service supply chain. Liminal Panda was observed compromising upstream IT service vendors with long-term access into telecom operations. Salt Typhoon focused on exploiting vulnerabilities in open-source software commonly embedded in telecom service delivery. These attacks demonstrate the growing threat posed by compromised third-party providers in telecom ecosystems.\r\n\r\nThe adversary may use the compromised service to apply additional techniques against interfaces exposed to the service provider such as the NEF.

Confidentiality and integrity protection requirements are not specified by O-RAN Alliance for control, user and synchronization (CUS) planes, and those are mandatory for M plane. See clause 6.1 of [2] and clause 5.4 of [3]. Also, 3GPP has defined algorithms for user plane data integrity protection. Many MNOs do not use those algorithms to reduce processing delay.

The open fronthaul interface makes it possible to distribute the physical layer functionalities between RU and DU, and to control RU operations from DU. O-RAN Alliance has selected a specific configuration (split 7.2x) for splitting the physical layer among those proposed by 3GPP. The lower part of the physical layer (low PHY) resides in RU and performs Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) phase compensation, inverse FFT and Cyclic Prefix (CP) insertion for frequency-to-time conversion in downlink, and FFT and CP removal in uplink. The physical layer in DU (high PHY) performs scrambling, modulation, layer mapping, and resource element mapping. Open fronthaul consists of four types of interfaces: Control or C plane is used to carry control plane messages for the RAN such as beamforming and scheduling commands. User or U plane is used to carry user plane data which includes IQ data (contains UE's CP & UP data) in FFT frequency domain for both DL & UL directions.

This technique then enables an adversary to successfully decrypt the user data that passes through a fake or compromised base station that the adversary is using. \r\n\r\nThe false base station deployed in locations close to the subscriber of interest lures the UE to connect to it and start a registration procedure. The false base station may advertise a spoofed PLMN ID and cell ID in order to trigger a new registration. \r\n\r\nFor 4G, this request for keys is carried over the Diameter protocol (e.g., the AIR- Authentication-Information-Request), and it has as origin a spoofed PLMN ID (e.g., the PLMN ID of the home network of the UE (as in [1]), or another PLMN ID (of a legitimate roaming partner) that is accepted by the Diameter firewall of the home network of the victim UE) (see FGT1036.501). Then, the home network returns the authentication vectors and the false base station completes the registration procedure and the user data session is started, encrypted with the radio interface keys that the false base station has obtained. Thus, the adversary can decrypt all traffic from the UE, all the while providing data service (in order to remain undetected by the user). \r\n\r\nFor 5G, the attack is more complex because it requires the cooperation of a colluding cellular operator. The UE must first be tricked to connect to the false base station advertising the PLMN ID of the colluding roaming partner. After this, the adversary sends a fraudulent HTTP\u002F2 message carrying an authentication request. The 5G authentication procedure takes place between the UE, the colluding PLMN, and the home PLMN of the UE. After this, the false base station is finally in possession of the keys for radio interface and is able to decrypt user traffic. Thus, the adversary can decrypt all traffic from the UE, all the while providing data service. The UE may or may not show to the user the PLMN that the UE is attaching to, thus this attack may remain undetected at the subscriber side.

The adversary may choose to jam both frequency bands in case of out-of-band deployment to disrupt both backhaul and access communications.\r\n\r\nThe adversary may impact communications of the target IAB node, the IAB nodes that are downstream from the target IAB node and all UEs that are connected to the target IAB node and all UEs that are connected to downstream IAB nodes.

This can result in service disruption and denial-of-service attacks, as attackers may deregister network functions, disrupt authentication processes, or manipulate network policies. Furthermore, improperly scoped tokens can enable privilege escalation and API abuse, allowing attackers to perform actions meant for higher-privileged entities, thereby compromising network security. Such vulnerabilities undermine the network trust model, weakening service-to-service communication integrity and increasing the risk of lateral attacks.","OAuth2.0 Scope Exploitation","The adversary must first gain control of a Network Function (NF) that holds valid operator credentials. Once in control, the malicious NF needs to obtain valid access tokens from the Network Repository Function (NRF). This step is generally achievable if the NF is recognized as a legitimate entity within the system. Token exploitation can occur if the OAuth2.0 implementation treats the scope parameter in token issuance as optional. When this parameter is not properly restricted, it can lead to over-privileged access. Such a lack of granular access control typically arises when NF producers fail to specify detailed \"additional scope\" parameters.","OAuth2.0 scope exploitation","a) Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack: An attacker could intercept the token request and response between the client and the authorization server, gaining access to the access token.b) Token Leakage: If the access token is stored insecurely on the client-side or transmitted over an unsecured channel, it could be exposed to attackers.c) Token Replay Attack: An attacker might attempt to reuse an intercepted access token to gain unauthorized access to the protected resources.","Eavesdropping the token during transmission","a) Stolen Client Credentials: If the client credentials (client ID and client secret) are not properly secured, an attacker could steal them through various means, such as through a compromised server, source code leak, or other security vulnerabilities.b) Brute Force Attack: An attacker could try to guess the client credentials through a brute force attack if the credentials are not strong enough.c) Eavesdropping the client credential during transmission: An attacker could eavesdrop on the transmission of client credentials between the client and server during the client registration process.","Disclosure of client credentials","Getting hold of the token through various injection attacks can be executed through an application or instance that doesn't fall directly under the control of the operators.
