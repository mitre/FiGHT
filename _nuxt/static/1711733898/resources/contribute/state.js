This leads to disclosure of UE authentication and authorization information, and NF IP addresses and other topology information.\r\n\r\nThe adversary positioned on an IPX node may collect data over the N32 interface while a UE is roaming, if a SEPP has used encryption on some parts of the messages sent, or used a weak cipher for JWE encryption. Similarly, an adversary positioned on a SEPP can observe or easily decrypt signaling messages sent on the N32 interface.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, if the EPC interworking interface N26 for non-roaming is not encrypted, all subscriber signaling data may be exposed to adversary.\r\n\r\nAdversary may also use compromised virtualized network elements to (vSwitch\u002FvRouter, Virtual Firewalls) to span traffic to a sniffing port for access to traffic flows and user\u002Fsystem data. In a virtualized environment access can be gained much more easily as the servers making up a function are more likely to be physically and virtually distributed and the SDN vSwitch would allow an adversary to fork IP packets flowing between hosts remotely much more easily. Such forking is very difficult to detect or prevent from within a 3GPP NF or VM, and adversaries may be able to read data in transit. \r\n\r\nAn adversary may utilize these observations for several follow-on techniques.\r\n\r\n","#### Addendum Name: Fronthaul\r\n##### Architecture Segments: \r\n Adversaries may sniff network traffic to capture information about fronthaul user plane.\r\n\r\nORAN Alliance has defined the open fronthaul interface which connects one O-DU to one or more O-RUs inside the gNB. The fronthaul interface makes it possible to distribute the physical layer functionalities between RU and DU, and to control RU operations from DU. ORAN Alliance has selected a specific configuration (split 7.2x) for splitting of the physical layer among those proposed by 3GPP. The lower part of the physical layer (low PHY) resides in RU and performs Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) phase compensation, inverse FFT and Cyclic Prefix (CP) insertion for frequency-to-time conversion in downlink, and FFT and CP removal in uplink. The physical layer in DU (high PHY) performs scrambling, modulation, layer mapping, and resource element mapping. Fronthaul consists of four types of interfaces: Control or C plane is used to carry control plane messages, User or U plane is used to carry user plane data, Synchronization or S plane is used to carry timing information and Management or M plane is used to carry management data.\r\n\r\nO-RAN fronthaul interface needs to implement strict performance requirements which includes very high throughput and very low latency. See clause 4.4 of [2]. Some security features may not be implemented by MNOs to meet those requirements and to reduce processing delay. Hence, Adversary on the Side (AoTS) attack on open fronthaul interface is possible which results in passive eavesdropping of U plane data. The adversary may use a simple sniffer device to monitor all U plane communications which is normally not encrypted at lower 3 layers (RLC, MAC and PHY). Confidentiality and integrity protection requirements are not specified by ORAN alliance for control, user and synchronization (CUS) planes, and those are mandatory for M plane. See clause 6.1 of [2] and clause 5.4 of [3].\r\n\r\nNote: The user plane data in PDCP and above layers remains encrypted on Fronthaul U plane and this eavesdrop attack will not impact any of those data unless PDCP security is also broken by the adversary.\r\n\r\n"];R["architecture-segment"]=b;R.bluf=nR;R.criticalassets=[{Description:"Sensitive User signaling such as authentication data, user location for the N32 interface",Name:"UE data on roaming signaling interface"},{Description:"User data for the N9 interface",Name:"UE data on roaming user plane interface"},{Description:"Signaling data, provisioning data, service discovery",Name:"UP, CP Data"},{Description:"Sensitive subscriber user plane data will be available to the adversary.",Name:"Sensitive subscriber data"}];R.description="Adversaries may sniff network traffic to capture information about an environment, including authentication material passed over the network.\r\n[To read more, please see the MITRE ATT&CK page for this technique](https:\u002F\u002Fattack.mitre.org\u002Ftechniques\u002FT1040)\r\n";R.detections=[{detects:"Monitor processes which may sniff data.",fgdsid:df,name:dg},{detects:"Monitor for allowed modifications relative to the agreed upon modifications per roaming agreements and agreements with IPX.",fgdsid:o,name:p},{detects:"Monitor commands given to NFs which may help data sniffing.",fgdsid:em,name:en},{detects:js,fgdsid:jt,name:ju},{detects:nS,fgdsid:jv,name:jw}];R.id=W;R.mitigations=[{fgmid:jx,mitigates:"Use zero trust for NF protection",name:jy},{fgmid:hb,mitigates:"Encrypt using TLS all links between NFs and between NF and SCP",name:hc},{fgmid:gr,mitigates:"Monitor to ensure configurations do not change from acceptable options",name:gs},{fgmid:D,mitigates:"Non-SBI: Use encryption (IPSec) on these interfaces.

The fronthaul interface makes it possible to distribute the physical layer functionalities between RU and DU, and to control RU operations from DU. ORAN Alliance has selected a specific configuration (split 7.2x) for splitting the physical layer among those proposed by 3GPP. The lower part of the physical layer (low PHY) resides in RU and performs Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) phase compensation, inverse FFT and Cyclic Prefix (CP) insertion for frequency-to-time conversion in downlink, and FFT and CP removal in uplink. The physical layer in DU (high PHY) performs scrambling, modulation, layer mapping, and resource element mapping. Fronthaul consists of four types of interfaces: Control or C plane is used to carry control plane messages, User or U plane is used to carry user plane data, Synchronization or S plane is used to carry timing information and Management or M plane is used to carry management data.\r\n\r\nO-RAN fronthaul interface needs to implement strict performance requirements which includes very high throughput and very low latency. See clause 4.4 of [2]. Some security features may not be implemented by MNOs to meet those requirements and to reduce processing delay. Hence, AiTM attack on open fronthaul interface is possible which results in manipulation of U plane data. The adversary may manipulate RLC and MAC layers of the user plane data to cause DoS attack and\u002For session redirection attack (e.g. DNS redirection) on legitimate subscribers. Confidentiality and integrity protection requirements are not specified by ORAN alliance for control, user and synchronization (CUS) planes, and those are mandatory for M plane. See clause 6.1 of [2] and clause 5.4 of [3].\r\n\r\nNote: The user plane data in PDCP and above layers remains integrity protected on Fronthaul U plane and this data manipulation attack will not impact any of those data unless PDCP security is also broken by the adversary.\r\n\r\n","#### Addendum Name: Layer 2 Redirection of DNS Requests\r\n##### Architecture Segments: \r\n An adversary can manipulate encrypted traffic to achieve redirection of DNS requests sent by the victim UE to the network over the radio interface.\r\n\r\nUsing a fake gNB and fake UE device, the adversary can modify DNS requests the UE sends over the air, even though they are encrypted, if the adversary knows the correct DNS address and there is no integrity protection on user plane data[1].  User plane integrity protections prevent this attack on typical 5G RAN links, however these protections are optional.  Alternatively, an adversary may have bid-down the UE as a precondition to achieve the effect.\r\n  \r\n","#### Addendum Name: Network Interfaces\r\n##### Architecture Segments: \r\n Adversary with access to a non-Service Based Interface (non-SBI) node or an SBI Network Function (NF), or a function on the roaming\u002Finterconnect interfaces, may manipulate or spoof user plane and control plane traffic on that interface without integrity protection, towards a DOS or other attacks on the UE or a NF.\r\n\r\nThe following Network interfaces are in the scope of this document.\r\n\r\n1. “Non-SBI” (non-Service Based Interface) network interfaces are within 5G core (e.g. N4) and RAN (e.g. Xn, F1, E1), and between the RAN and the 5G Core (e.g. N2, N3 interfaces). \r\n\r\n2. SBI network interfaces are between core NFs within an operator network; they use REST APIs.\r\n\r\n3. Roaming and interconnect interfaces, including IPX, are between network operators (between SEPPs (N32), between UPFs (N9), or interworking functions like between AMF and MME (N26)).\r\n\r\nUnlike radio communications, within operator RAN and from RAN to core communications do not always employ integrity protection as per standards. If the gNB does not provide integrity protection for control plane (CP) packets sent on the N2\u002FXn-C\u002FF1-C\u002FE1 interfaces or does not provide user plane (UP) integrity protection for user plane packets sent on the N3\u002FXn-U\u002FF1-U interfaces, or UPF does not provide integrity protection for user plane packets sent on the N9 interface, then data manipulation (alteration of messages, insertion\u002Fspoofing of messages, or replay of legitimate signaling messages) is possible. This may result in DOS. \r\n\r\nThe adversary with access to the SBI links, for example, with control over a middlebox (not including the Service Communication Proxy or SCP), may manipulate or inject spoofed signaling messages if TLS integrity is not enabled or is using a weak algorithm.\r\n \r\nIf an IPX disables JWS signature or uses a weak algorithm for JWS signature, an AiTM may manipulate data over the N32 interface while a UE is roaming.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, if the EPC interworking interface N26 for non-roaming is not integrity protected, all subscriber signaling data may be manipulated by adversary.

The front haul interface plays a crucial role in connecting the DU and the Remote Radio Unit (RU or RRU) within the network, ensuring efficient communication. \r\n\r\nTo transport the CPRI (Common Public Radio Interface) traffic from the RU to the DU, an Ethernet-based bridged network is employed. This involves utilizing various Ethernet protocols such as IEEE 802.3 for general Ethernet connectivity, IEEE 802.1 for bridging and VLAN tagging, and IEEE 802.1CM for time-sensitive networking in industrial automation. The Ethernet-based fronthaul interface establishes a high-capacity and low-latency connection between the DU and the RU, facilitating the efficient transmission of digital baseband data, synchronization signals, control signals, and management information. Usually, RUs and Ethernet Switches are placed near the antenna units, which are unmanned facilities and can be physically breached due to detection and response time delays by personnel. \r\n\r\nUnauthorized devices on this infrastructure can pose significant risks to the O-RAN network. Such devices can be used towards a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack by sending malicious or bogus messages, disrupting network operations.
