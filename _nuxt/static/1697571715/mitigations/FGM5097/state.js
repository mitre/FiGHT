This leads to disclosure of UE authentication and authorization information, and NF IP addresses and other topology information.\r\n\r\nThe adversary positioned on an IPX node may collect data over the N32 interface while a UE is roaming, if a SEPP has used encryption on some parts of the messages sent, or used a weak cipher for JWE encryption. Similarly, an adversary positioned on a SEPP can observe or easily decrypt signaling messages sent on the N32 interface.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, if the EPC interworking interface N26 for non-roaming is not encrypted, all subscriber signaling data may be exposed to adversary.\r\n\r\nAdversary may also use compromised virtualized network elements to (vSwitch\u002FvRouter, Virtual Firewalls) to span traffic to a sniffing port for access to traffic flows and user\u002Fsystem data. In a virtualized environment access can be gained much more easily as the servers making up a function are more likely to be physically and virtually distributed and the SDN vSwitch would allow an adversary to fork IP packets flowing between hosts remotely much more easily. Such forking is very difficult to detect or prevent from within a 3GPP NF or VM, and adversaries may be able to read data in transit. \r\n\r\nAn adversary may utilize these observations for several follow-on techniques.\r\n\r\n","#### Addendum Name: _Fronthaul\r\n##### Architecture Segments: User Plane, Control Plane, Roaming, Virtualization\r\n Adversaries may sniff network traffic to capture information about fronthaul user plane.\r\n\r\nORAN Alliance has defined the open fronthaul interface which connects one O-DU to one or more O-RUs inside the gNB. The fronthaul interface makes it possible to distribute the physical layer functionalities between RU and DU, and to control RU operations from DU. ORAN Alliance has selected a specific configuration (split 7.2x) for splitting of the physical layer among those proposed by 3GPP. The lower part of the physical layer (low PHY) resides in RU and performs Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) phase compensation, inverse FFT and Cyclic Prefix (CP) insertion for frequency-to-time conversion in downlink, and FFT and CP removal in uplink. The physical layer in DU (high PHY) performs scrambling, modulation, layer mapping, and resource element mapping. Fronthaul consists of four types of interfaces: Control or C plane is used to carry control plane messages, User or U plane is used to carry user plane data, Synchronization or S plane is used to carry timing information and Management or M plane is used to carry management data.\r\n\r\nO-RAN fronthaul interface needs to implement strict performance requirements which includes very high throughput and very low latency. See clause 4.4 of [2]. Some security features may not be implemented by MNOs to meet those requirements and to reduce processing delay. Hence, Adversary on the Side (AoTS) attack on open fronthaul interface is possible which results in passive eavesdropping of U plane data. The adversary may use a simple sniffer device to monitor all U plane communications which is normally not encrypted at lower 3 layers (RLC, MAC and PHY). Confidentiality and integrity protection requirements are not specified by ORAN alliance for control, user and synchronization (CUS) planes, and those are mandatory for M plane. See clause 6.1 of [2] and clause 5.4 of [3].\r\n\r\nNote: The user plane data in PDCP and above layers remains encrypted on Fronthaul U plane and this eavesdrop attack will not impact any of those data unless PDCP security is also broken by the adversary.\r\n\r\n"];X["architecture-segment"]=oC;X.bluf=oD;X.criticalassets=[{Description:"Sensitive User signaling such as authentication data, user location for the N32 interface",Name:"UE data on roaming signaling interface"},{Description:"User data for the N9 interface",Name:"UE data on roaming user plane interface"},{Description:"Signaling data, provisioning data, service discovery",Name:"UP, CP Data"},{Description:"Sensitive subscriber user plane data will be available to the adversary.",Name:"Sensitive subscriber data"}];X.description="Adversaries may sniff network traffic to capture information about an environment, including authentication material passed over the network.\r\n[To read more, please see the MITRE ATT&CK page for this technique](https:\u002F\u002Fattack.mitre.org\u002Ftechniques\u002FT1040)\r\n";X.detections=[{detects:"Monitor processes which may sniff data.",fgdsid:dh,name:di},{detects:"Monitor for allowed modifications relative to the agreed upon modifications per roaming agreements and agreements with IPX.",fgdsid:o,name:p},{detects:"Monitor commands given to NFs which may help data sniffing.",fgdsid:ft,name:fu},{detects:oE,fgdsid:jL,name:jM}];X.id=au;X.mitigations=[{fgmid:jN,mitigates:"Use zero trust for NF protection",name:jO},{fgmid:hk,mitigates:"Encrypt using TLS all links between NFs and between NF and SCP",name:hl},{fgmid:gH,mitigates:"Monitor to ensure configurations do not change from acceptable options",name:gI},{fgmid:H,mitigates:"Non-SBI: Use encryption (IPSec) on these interfaces.

A compromise of controls placed to maintain security zones or network segmentation based on IP networks, application groups or slices may allow an adversary to gain unauthorized access to networks or services. This may occur at a Core, RAN, Cloud or Slice boundary.\r\n\r\nOnce the adversary has infiltrated the internals of the network, it has ample opportunities and a much broader attack surface to explore.

These boundaries can also exist between different network components, such as radio access, core, edge, and cloud, as well as between national or international links and operator cores, and service providers or operator cores.\r\nIn some cases, firewalls may be used to separate these zones, such as SS7 protocol, Diameter protocol, 5G APIs, enhanced SCP (Service Communication Proxy), IP (Internet Protocol), SIP (Session Initiation Protocol), and GTP (GPRS Tunneling Protocols) firewalls. Alternatively, an interworking function may be used to translate one protocol into another.

The rest of the IMSI (24 bits) can be tried out by brute force by sending many paging messages (e.g. via a fake base station) corresponding to the IMSIs being tried out, and if one gets a response that is valid, it means that the guess is correct. \r\n\r\n\r\nSeveral UEs may end up sharing the same paging occasion. With knowledge of the victim’s phone number, an adversary can cause the victim UE to be paged in a certain fashion (e.g. by sending a given number of silent SMS and watching for a similar number of paging messages), the adversary can determine the paging occasion for that UE. If the UE is not located in that cell area, then no such paging messages will be noticed. An adversary needs to install sniffers in all of the cell areas of interest, i.e. where they desire to determine the presence or absence of a target UE at a given time, and\u002For to determine the UE identifiers (IMSI or SUPI or TMSI).\r\n\r\n\r\nBackground information: the IMSI in the US is ~49 bits, but the IMSI’s leading 18-bits (i.e., the mobile country code and the mobile network code) can be obtained from the phone number using paid, Internet-based home location register lookup services. The “paging occasion” – the precise time\u002Ffrequency slot when the paging indication is sent—is calculated in a known way based on a UE identifier- either IMSI or TMSI.\r\n\r\n";bs.detections=[{detects:rJ,fgdsid:kr,name:ks}];bs.id=hJ;bs.mitigations=[{fgmid:dR,mitigates:"The operator may run a network side SMS firewall that permits legitimate silent SMSs (e.g. from law enforcement) but blocks the ones from suspicious sources",name:dS},{fgmid:kt,mitigates:"Run at the UE side a tool to detect and not respond to multiple silent SMS messages received in a short time (can be OS monitoring app as in [2])",name:ku}];bs.name="Silent SMS";bs["object-type"]=c;bs.platforms=b;bs.preconditions=[{Description:"Adversary deployed a sniffer in the coverage area where the target UE may be located",Name:"Radio interface sniffer"}];bs.procedureexamples=[{Description:"By sending several (about 8) silent SMS messages to a UE, (or make 8 silent calls), and watching the responses on the radio interface- if the UE is present, the paging occasion of the UE can be determined [1].",Name:"Paging occasion guessing"},{Description:"If the operator uses IMSI to page UEs, then if some bits of the IMSI are already guessed (e.g. via a location\u002Fpaging occasion guessing discovery technique), it is possible to infer the actual IMSI.

During training, they can engage in data poisoning by injecting manipulated data (Data Injection), mislabeling data points (Label Poisoning), or maliciously augmenting data with adversarial samples (Data Augmentation Poisoning). Adversaries can also manipulate the model itself during training, introducing hidden backdoor patterns (Backdoor Attacks) or deducing sensitive information by observing model outputs (Model Inversion Attacks). In the inference phase, they can create adversarial examples to trick the model (Adversarial Examples) or subtly change data distributions over time to cause incorrect predictions (Concept Drift). Additionally, adversaries can engage in data pollution by manipulating live input data (Data Poisoning in Live Systems) or compromise model integrity by stealing and manipulating training data (Data Theft).
