These services may include outsourced IT operations, software development, integration and deployments, IP transport, Cloud hosting, helpdesk etc. This technique pertains specifically to external managed service providers (e.g., contracted IT or cloud services) rather than internal enterprise support functions where corporate security rules may be different or not verifiable. \r\n\r\nFor example, threat actors such as Liminal Panda (CrowdStrike, 2024) and Salt Typhoon (Tenable, 2024), state-sponsored actors targeted telecom providers by compromising their service supply chain. Liminal Panda was observed compromising upstream IT service vendors with long-term access into telecom operations. Salt Typhoon focused on exploiting vulnerabilities in open-source software commonly embedded in telecom service delivery. These attacks demonstrate the growing threat posed by compromised third-party providers in telecom ecosystems.\r\n\r\nThe adversary may use the compromised service to apply additional techniques against interfaces exposed to the service provider such as the NEF. When the service provider hosts or provides core network functions, the adversary may attempt to compromise the 5G core components in the service provider environment, e.g. MEC hosted NFs, or through the service provider environment, attempt compromise of other core NFs not hosted in the MEC.

The fronthaul interface makes it possible to distribute the physical layer functionalities between RU and DU, and to control RU operations from DU. ORAN Alliance has selected a specific configuration (split 7.2x) for splitting of the physical layer among those proposed by 3GPP. The lower part of the physical layer (low PHY) resides in RU and performs Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) phase compensation, inverse FFT and Cyclic Prefix (CP) insertion for frequency-to-time conversion in downlink, and FFT and CP removal in uplink. The physical layer in DU (high PHY) performs scrambling, modulation, layer mapping, and resource element mapping. Fronthaul consists of four types of interfaces: Control or C plane is used to carry control plane messages, User or U plane is used to carry user plane data, Synchronization or S plane is used to carry timing information and Management or M plane is used to carry management data.\r\n\r\nO-RAN fronthaul interface needs to implement strict performance requirements which includes very high throughput and very low latency. See clause 4.4 of [2]. Some security features may not be implemented by MNOs to meet those requirements and to reduce processing delay. Hence, Adversary on the Side (AoTS) attack on open fronthaul interface is possible which results in passive eavesdropping of U plane data. The adversary may use a simple sniffer device to monitor all U plane communications which is normally not encrypted at lower 3 layers (RLC, MAC and PHY).

The ARP protocol is used to resolve IPv4 addresses to link layer addresses, such as a media access control (MAC) address.(Citation: RFC826 ARP) Devices in a local network segment communicate with each other by using link layer addresses. If a networked device does not have the link layer address of a particular networked device, it may send out a broadcast ARP request to the local network to translate the IP address to a MAC address. The device with the associated IP address directly replies with its MAC address. The networked device that made the ARP request will then use as well as store that information in its ARP cache. An adversary may passively wait for an ARP request to poison the ARP cache of the requesting device. The adversary may reply with their MAC address, thus deceiving the victim by making them believe that they are communicating with the intended networked device. For the adversary to poison the ARP cache, their reply must be faster than the one made by the legitimate IP address owner. Adversaries may also send a gratuitous ARP reply that maliciously announces the ownership of a particular IP address to all the devices in the local network segment. The ARP protocol is stateless and does not require authentication. Therefore, devices may wrongly add or update the MAC address of the IP address in their ARP cache.(Citation: Sans ARP Spoofing Aug 2003)(Citation: Cylance Cleaver) Adversaries may use ARP cache poisoning as a means to intercept network traffic.

Examples include creating a container configured to mount the host's filesystem using the bind parameter, which allows the adversary to drop payloads and execute control utilities such as cron on the host; utilizing a privileged container to run commands or load a malicious kernel module on the underlying host; or abusing system calls such as `unshare` and `keyctl` to escalate privileges and steal secrets.(Citation: Docker Bind Mounts)(Citation: Trend Micro Privileged Container)(Citation: Intezer Doki July 20)(Citation: Container Escape)(Citation: Crowdstrike Kubernetes Container Escape)(Citation: Keyctl-unmask) Additionally, an adversary may be able to exploit a compromised container with a mounted container management socket, such as `docker.sock`, to break out of the container via a [Container Administration Command](https:\u002F\u002Fattack.mitre.org\u002Ftechniques\u002FT1609).(Citation: Container Escape) Adversaries may also escape via [Exploitation for Privilege Escalation](https:\u002F\u002Fattack.mitre.org\u002Ftechniques\u002FT1068), such as exploiting vulnerabilities in global symbolic links in order to access the root directory of a host machine.(Citation: Windows Server Containers Are Open) Gaining access to the host may provide the adversary with the opportunity to achieve follow-on objectives, such as establishing persistence, moving laterally within the environment, or setting up a command and control channel on the host.[To read more, please see the MITRE ATT&CK page for this technique](https:\u002F\u002Fattack.mitre.org\u002Ftechniques\u002FT1611)";bT.detections=[{component:dJ,detects:Ni,fgdsid:dK,name:S},{component:hJ,detects:Nj,fgdsid:hK,name:bW},{component:uG,detects:Nk,fgdsid:uH,name:cI},{component:uI,detects:Nl,fgdsid:uJ,name:cI},{component:uK,detects:Nm,fgdsid:uL,name:cI},{component:uM,detects:uN,fgdsid:uO,name:cI},{component:pq,detects:uP,fgdsid:pr,name:cI}];bT.groups=[{description:uQ,fggid:lJ,name:lK}];bT.id=aS;bT.mitigations=[{fgmid:uR,mitigates:Nn,name:uS},{fgmid:mm,mitigates:No,name:mn},{fgmid:ae,mitigates:Np,name:af}];bT.name=jI;bT["object-type"]=c;bT.postconditions=[];bT.preconditions=[];bT.procedureexamples=[];bT.references=[Nq,Nr,Ns,Nt];bT.software=[{description:uT,fgsid:lL,name:lM},{description:uU,fgsid:uV,name:uW},{description:uX,fgsid:hd,name:he},{description:uY,fgsid:uZ,name:u_}];bT.status=Nv;bT.tactics=[da,gY];bT.typecode=u;bT.route="\u002Ftechniques\u002FFGT1611";bT.relatedObjects={addendums:[a],"architecture-segment":ck,bluf:Nu,campaigns:[],criticalassets:[a,a,a],detections:[a,a,a,a,a,a,a],groups:[a],mitigations:[a,a,a],postconditions:[],preconditions:[],procedureexamples:[],references:[a,a,a,a],software:[a,a,a,a],status:Nv,tactics:[db,gZ],typecode:u,"data source":[fP,hL,vt,vu,vv,vw,pO],mitigation:[aR,vx,OW],subtechniques:[cH]};bU["access-required"]=mj;bU["architecture-segment"]=fm;bU.bluf=NF;bU.campaigns=[];bU.criticalassets=[{description:"Container and container engine may expose privileged information to adversary directly from process or through container engine.",name:"Container engines"},{description:wJ,name:"NFVO"},{description:"Virtual Infrastructure Manager.",name:"VIM"}];bU.description="An adversary may use a fake or compromised container management controller to deploy fake VNFs to collect information from the network.\r\n\r\nInstantiation of malicious Virtual Network Functions (VNF) can also be achieved by compromised VIM by inclusion of concealed software within legitimate (Virtual Infrastructure Manager) VIM, or allocating virtual resources for fake instances, or using malicious or compromised identity provider (reuses the same identity for several VNFs with same key pair without knowledge of MANO).

The adversary can, e.g., conduct privilege escalation and process injection for gaining administrative rights, attempt password cracking of valid user accounts on the nodes, exploit vulnerabilities in databases and file systems, and take advantage of improper configurations of routers and switches.\r\n\r\nThe boundaries of a network and its security zones can exist between various technologies, such as 4G and 5G, or between different partners, such as private networks, mobile operators, or Mobile Virtual Network Operators (MVNOs). These boundaries can also exist between different network components, such as radio access, core, edge, and cloud, as well as between national or international links and operator cores, and service providers or operator cores.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, firewalls may be used to separate these zones, such as SS7 protocol, Diameter protocol, 5G APIs, enhanced SCP (Service Communication Proxy), IP (Internet Protocol), SIP (Session Initiation Protocol), and GTP (GPRS Tunneling Protocols) firewalls. Alternatively, an interworking function may be used to translate one protocol into another. However, it's important to note that privileged access is not always necessary to bypass a firewall or exploit an interworking function. Often, insufficient filtering may be the cause, or the filtering may not be sufficiently deep.",platforms:[aM],preconditions:[{description:xM,name:xN}],procedureexamples:[{description:xO,name:xP},{description:xQ,name:xR}],references:[gp,ki],software:[]}];cq["architecture-segment"]=xS;cq.bluf=xT;cq.campaigns=[];cq.criticalassets=[{description:xD,name:xE}];cq.description="Adversaries may bridge network boundaries by compromising perimeter network devices or internal devices responsible for network segmentation. Breaching these devices may enable an adversary to bypass restrictions on traffic routing that otherwise separate trusted and untrusted networks. Devices such as routers and firewalls can be used to create boundaries between trusted and untrusted networks. They achieve this by restricting traffic types to enforce organizational policy in an attempt to reduce the risk inherent in such connections. Restriction of traffic can be achieved by prohibiting IP addresses, layer 4 protocol ports, or through deep packet inspection to identify applications. To participate with the rest of the network, these devices can be directly addressable or transparent, but their mode of operation has no bearing on how the adversary can bypass them when compromised. When an adversary takes control of such a boundary device, they can bypass its policy enforcement to pass normally prohibited traffic across the trust boundary between the two separated networks without hinderance. By achieving sufficient rights on the device, an adversary can reconfigure the device to allow the traffic they want, allowing them to then further achieve goals such as command and control via [Multi-hop Proxy](https:\u002F\u002Fattack.mitre.org\u002Ftechniques\u002FT1090\u002F003) or exfiltration of data via [Traffic Duplication](https:\u002F\u002Fattack.mitre.org\u002Ftechniques\u002FT1020\u002F001).

Endpoint DoS can be performed by exhausting the system resources those services are hosted on or exploiting the system to cause a persistent crash condition. Example services include websites, email services, DNS, and web-based applications. Adversaries have been observed conducting DoS attacks for political purposes(Citation: FireEye OpPoisonedHandover February 2016) and to support other malicious activities, including distraction(Citation: FSISAC FraudNetDoS September 2012), hacktivism, and extortion.(Citation: Symantec DDoS October 2014) An Endpoint DoS denies the availability of a service without saturating the network used to provide access to the service. Adversaries can target various layers of the application stack that is hosted on the system used to provide the service. These layers include the Operating Systems (OS), server applications such as web servers, DNS servers, databases, and the (typically web-based) applications that sit on top of them. Attacking each layer requires different techniques that take advantage of bottlenecks that are unique to the respective components. A DoS attack may be generated by a single system or multiple systems spread across the internet, which is commonly referred to as a distributed DoS (DDoS). To perform DoS attacks against endpoint resources, several aspects apply to multiple methods, including IP address spoofing and botnets. Adversaries may use the original IP address of an attacking system, or spoof the source IP address to make the attack traffic more difficult to trace back to the attacking system or to enable reflection. This can increase the difficulty defenders have in defending against the attack by reducing or eliminating the effectiveness of filtering by the source address on network defense devices. Botnets are commonly used to conduct DDoS attacks against networks and services. Large botnets can generate a significant amount of traffic from systems spread across the global internet. Adversaries may have the resources to build out and control their own botnet infrastructure or may rent time on an existing botnet to conduct an attack. In some of the worst cases for DDoS, so many systems are used to generate requests that each one only needs to send out a small amount of traffic to produce enough volume to exhaust the target's resources. In such circumstances, distinguishing DDoS traffic from legitimate clients becomes exceedingly difficult. Botnets have been used in some of the most high-profile DDoS attacks, such as the 2012 series of incidents that targeted major US banks.(Citation: USNYAG IranianBotnet March 2016) In cases where traffic manipulation is used, there may be points in the global network (such as high traffic gateway routers) where packets can be altered and cause legitimate clients to execute code that directs network packets toward a target in high volume. This type of capability was previously used for the purposes of web censorship where client HTTP traffic was modified to include a reference to JavaScript that generated the DDoS code to overwhelm target web servers.(Citation: ArsTechnica Great Firewall of China) For attacks attempting to saturate the providing network, see [Network Denial of Service](https:\u002F\u002Fattack.mitre.org\u002Ftechniques\u002FT1498).[To read more, please see the MITRE ATT&CK page for this technique](https:\u002F\u002Fattack.mitre.org\u002Ftechniques\u002FT1499)";dC.detections=[{component:j,detects:JT,fgdsid:k,name:e}];dC.groups=[];dC.id=dL;dC.mitigations=[{fgmid:bI,mitigates:JU,name:bJ},{fgmid:t$,mitigates:JV,name:ua}];dC.name=Kp;dC["object-type"]=c;dC.postconditions=[{description:"SMO suffers from very high processing load and\u002For resource exhaustion (CPU, memory, storage access).",name:"SMO operations impacted"}];dC.preconditions=[{description:JX,name:JY}];dC.procedureexamples=[{description:JZ,name:J_}];dC.references=[mw,J$,Ka,Kb];dC.software=[];dC.status=b;dC.tactics=[F];dC.typecode=u;dC.route="\u002Ftechniques\u002FFGT1499";dC.relatedObjects={addendums:[a,a,a],"architecture-segment":Ko,bluf:oU,campaigns:[],criticalassets:[a,a,a,a,a,a,a],detections:[a],groups:[],mitigations:[a,a],postconditions:[a],preconditions:[a],procedureexamples:[a],references:[a,a,a,a],software:[],status:b,tactics:[G],typecode:u,"data source":[w],mitigation:[dp,Kq],subtechniques:[ej,dD,dE,cK,cL,cM]};dD["access-required"]=Kr;dD["architecture-segment"]=am;dD.bluf=Ks;dD.campaigns=[];dD.criticalassets=[{description:"Communications is denied until additional data usage is purchased.",name:Kt}];dD.description="A malicious app consumes subscriber data allocation to deny or degrade service to that UE.\r\n\r\nA malicious application might consume a UE's limited data plan, denying or throttling service.";dD.detections=[{component:j,detects:"Excessive data usage reported by UE or service provider.",fgdsid:k,name:e}];dD.groups=[];dD.id=mB;dD.mitigations=[{fgmid:Ku,mitigates:"Unlimited data plan.

One example of this type of attack is known as a simple HTTP flood, where an adversary sends a large number of HTTP requests to a web server to overwhelm it and\u002For an application that runs on top of it. This flood relies on raw volume to accomplish the objective, exhausting any of the various resources required by the victim software to provide the service.(Citation: Cloudflare HTTPflood) Another variation, known as a SSL renegotiation attack, takes advantage of a protocol feature in SSL\u002FTLS. The SSL\u002FTLS protocol suite includes mechanisms for the client and server to agree on an encryption algorithm to use for subsequent secure connections. If SSL renegotiation is enabled, a request can be made for renegotiation of the crypto algorithm. In a renegotiation attack, the adversary establishes a SSL\u002FTLS connection and then proceeds to make a series of renegotiation requests.

Adversaries may be able to generate an increase in volume of attack traffic that is several orders of magnitude greater than the requests sent to the amplifiers. The extent of this increase will depending upon many variables, such as the protocol in question, the technique used, and the amplifying servers that actually produce the amplification in attack volume. Two prominent protocols that have enabled Reflection Amplification Floods are DNS(Citation: Cloudflare DNSamplficationDoS) and NTP(Citation: Cloudflare NTPamplifciationDoS), though the use of several others in the wild have been documented.(Citation: Arbor AnnualDoSreport Jan 2018) In particular, the memcache protocol showed itself to be a powerful protocol, with amplification sizes up to 51,200 times the requesting packet.(Citation: Cloudflare Memcrashed Feb 2018)[To read more, please see the MITRE ATT&CK page for this subtechnique](https:\u002F\u002Fattack.mitre.org\u002Ftechniques\u002FT1498\u002F002)";eP.detections=[{component:ng,detects:Cf,fgdsid:nh,name:bn}];eP.groups=[];eP.id=r_;eP.mitigations=[{fgmid:$,mitigates:Cg,name:aa}];eP.name="Reflection Amplification";eP["object-type"]=c;eP.postconditions=[{description:Cn,name:Co}];eP.preconditions=[{description:rU,name:rV},{description:rW,name:rX}];eP.procedureexamples=[{description:Ch,name:Ci}];eP.references=[Cj,rY,rZ,Ck,Cl];eP.software=[];eP.status=Cp;eP["subtechnique-of"]=iG;eP.tactics=[F];eP.typecode=C;eP.route="\u002Ftechniques\u002FFGT1498.002";eP.relatedObjects={addendums:[a],"architecture-segment":v,bluf:Cm,campaigns:[],criticalassets:[a,a],detections:[a],groups:[],mitigations:[a],postconditions:[a],preconditions:[a,a],procedureexamples:[a],references:[a,a,a,a,a],software:[],status:Cp,tactics:[G],typecode:C,"parent-technique":[hf],"data source":[ni],mitigation:[at],"other subtechniques":[dq,bq,cx,dj]};eQ["architecture-segment"]=an;eQ.bluf=Dy;eQ.campaigns=[];eQ.criticalassets=[{description:kZ,name:nK},{description:nL,name:hh}];eQ.description="Adversaries may use an unconventional port to obscure illicit communications.\r\n\r\nAdversaries may establish a command and control channel by hiding communication using an unconventional port.

Usually this series of packets consists of attempted connections to a predefined sequence of closed ports (i.e. [Port Knocking](https:\u002F\u002Fattack.mitre.org\u002Ftechniques\u002FT1205\u002F001)), but can involve unusual flags, specific strings, or other unique characteristics. After the sequence is completed, opening a port may be accomplished by the host-based firewall, but could also be implemented by custom software. Adversaries may also communicate with an already open port, but the service listening on that port will only respond to commands or trigger other malicious functionality if passed the appropriate magic value(s). The observation of the signal packets to trigger the communication can be conducted through different methods. One means, originally implemented by Cd00r (Citation: Hartrell cd00r 2002), is to use the libpcap libraries to sniff for the packets in question. Another method leverages raw sockets, which enables the malware to use ports that are already open for use by other programs. On network devices, adversaries may use crafted packets to enable [Network Device Authentication](https:\u002F\u002Fattack.mitre.org\u002Ftechniques\u002FT1556\u002F004) for standard services offered by the device such as telnet. Such signaling may also be used to open a closed service port such as telnet, or to trigger module modification of malware implants on the device, adding, removing, or changing malicious capabilities. Adversaries may use crafted packets to attempt to connect to one or more (open or closed) ports, but may also attempt to connect to a router interface, broadcast, and network address IP on the same port in order to achieve their goals and objectives.(Citation: Cisco Synful Knock Evolution)(Citation: Mandiant - Synful Knock)(Citation: Cisco Blog Legacy Device Attacks) To enable this traffic signaling on embedded devices, adversaries must first achieve and leverage [Patch System Image](https:\u002F\u002Fattack.mitre.org\u002Ftechniques\u002FT1601\u002F001) due to the monolithic nature of the architecture. Adversaries may also use the Wake-on-LAN feature to turn on powered off systems. Wake-on-LAN is a hardware feature that allows a powered down system to be powered on, or woken up, by sending a magic packet to it. Once the system is powered on, it may become a target for lateral movement.(Citation: Bleeping Computer - Ryuk WoL)(Citation: AMD Magic Packet)[To read more, please see the MITRE ATT&CK page for this technique](https:\u002F\u002Fattack.mitre.org\u002Ftechniques\u002FT1205)";fQ.detections=[{component:j,detects:sy,fgdsid:k,name:e},{component:dJ,detects:nM,fgdsid:dK,name:S}];fQ.groups=[{description:sC,fggid:J,name:K}];fQ.id=gv;fQ.mitigations=[{fgmid:Y,mitigates:nN,name:Z},{fgmid:i_,mitigates:sz,name:i$}];fQ.name=sD;fQ["object-type"]=c;fQ.postconditions=[];fQ.preconditions=[{description:sB,name:ja}];fQ.procedureexamples=[];fQ.references=[gJ,gK];fQ.software=[{description:k_,fgsid:fh,name:fi}];fQ.status=f;fQ.tactics=[L,aV,dV];fQ.typecode=u;fQ.route="\u002Ftechniques\u002FFGT1205";fQ.relatedObjects={addendums:[a],"architecture-segment":an,bluf:DA,campaigns:[],criticalassets:[a,a],detections:[a,a],groups:[a],mitigations:[a,a],postconditions:[],preconditions:[a],procedureexamples:[],references:[a,a],software:[a],status:f,tactics:[M,aW,dW],typecode:u,"data source":[fP,w],mitigation:[aJ,k$]};fR["architecture-segment"]=an;fR.bluf=DB;fR.campaigns=[];fR.criticalassets=[{description:kZ,name:nK},{description:nL,name:hh}];fR.description="Adversaries may use application layer protocol on an unconventional port to avoid detection or network filtering.\r\n\r\nAdversaries may compromise the external DNS (eDNS) server of a partner network using SSH for initial access with password spraying.

Network DoS can be performed by exhausting the network bandwidth services rely on. Example resources include specific websites, email services, DNS, and web-based applications.

For example, an adversary may send 10Gbps of traffic to a server that is hosted by a network with a 1Gbps connection to the internet. This traffic can be generated by a single system or multiple systems spread across the internet, which is commonly referred to as a distributed DoS (DDoS).

Adversaries may use the original IP address of an attacking system, or spoof the source IP address to make the attack traffic more difficult to trace back to the attacking system or to enable reflection.

A compromise of any of these components can potentially cause unintended changes to the network and expose user information.\r\n\r\nUnauthorized access to and manipulation of the gNB component can be carried out by a supply chain behavior or as a result of malicious updates using operator's management and deployment tools. Adversaries may also gain access by physically connecting to the device through an unsecured USB, serial, or COM port on the base station (or device hosting virtual CU\u002FDU\u002FRU\u002FRIC), or by remotely logging in using SSH or Telnet if strong access control is not implemented.\r\n\r\nIn distributed deployment architectures, APIs present additional threat vectors that can be exploited by adversaries. In shared RAN scenarios, the use of service configuration and management tools by multiple parties may increase the risk vectors.\r\n\r\n3GPP does not dictate deployment models, so it is possible that improper security hardening and separation of networks between RAN VNF and Core VNF in the same Cloud or MEC may further allow lateral movements of adversary if a gNodeB component is compromised.";kS.detections=[];kS.groups=[];kS.id=nA;kS.mitigations=[];kS.name="gNodeB Component Manipulation";kS["object-type"]=c;kS.platforms=R;kS.postconditions=[];kS.preconditions=[];kS.procedureexamples=[];kS.references=[];kS.software=[];kS.status=b;kS.tactics=[dc];kS.typecode=i;kS.route="\u002Ftechniques\u002FFGT5032";kS.relatedObjects={"access-required":aq,"architecture-segment":V,bluf:CW,campaigns:[],criticalassets:[a,a,a,a],detections:[],groups:[],mitigations:[],platforms:R,postconditions:[],preconditions:[],procedureexamples:[],references:[],software:[],status:b,tactics:[dd],typecode:i,subtechniques:[kT,bL,bM]};kT["access-required"]=aq;kT["architecture-segment"]=V;kT.bluf=CY;kT.campaigns=[];kT.criticalassets=[{description:"SMO, configuration and data related to gNodeB.",name:iA},{description:"Near-RT RIC and non-RT RIC, configuration and data related to gNodeB.",name:CX}];kT.description="\r\n\r\nAn adversary may compromise a RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) to affect radio network configuration.\r\n\r\nO-RAN architecture includes the RAN Intelligence Controllers (RICs), which consists of the Non-Real-Time RAN Intelligent Controller (Non-RT RIC) and the Near-Real-Time RAN Intelligent Controller (Near-RT RIC), to optimize radio resource management of gNB components.

This technique then enables an adversary to successfully decrypt the user data that passes through a fake or compromised base station that the adversary is using. \r\n\r\nThe false base station deployed in locations close to the subscriber of interest lures the UE to connect to it and start a registration procedure. The false base station may advertise a spoofed PLMN ID and cell ID in order to trigger a new registration. \r\n\r\nFor 4G, this request for keys is carried over the Diameter protocol (e.g., the AIR- Authentication-Information-Request), and it has as origin a spoofed PLMN ID (e.g., the PLMN ID of the home network of the UE (as in [1]), or another PLMN ID (of a legitimate roaming partner) that is accepted by the Diameter firewall of the home network of the victim UE) (see FGT1036.501). Then, the home network returns the authentication vectors and the false base station completes the registration procedure and the user data session is started, encrypted with the radio interface keys that the false base station has obtained. Thus, the adversary can decrypt all traffic from the UE, all the while providing data service (in order to remain undetected by the user). \r\n\r\nFor 5G, the attack is more complex because it requires the cooperation of a colluding cellular operator. The UE must first be tricked to connect to the false base station advertising the PLMN ID of the colluding roaming partner. After this, the adversary sends a fraudulent HTTP\u002F2 message carrying an authentication request. The 5G authentication procedure takes place between the UE, the colluding PLMN, and the home PLMN of the UE. After this, the false base station is finally in possession of the keys for radio interface and is able to decrypt user traffic. Thus, the adversary can decrypt all traffic from the UE, all the while providing data service. The UE may or may not show to the user the PLMN that the UE is attaching to, thus this attack may remain undetected at the subscriber side.

However, on jailbroken devices, malware has been discovered that can lock the user out of the device.(Citation: Xiao-KeyRaider)[To read more, please see the MITRE ATT&CK page for this technique](https:\u002F\u002Fattack.mitre.org\u002Ftechniques\u002FT1642)";lS.detections=[];lS.groups=[];lS.id=pS;lS.mitigations=[];lS.name=Kp;lS["object-type"]=c;lS.platforms=Qe;lS.postconditions=[];lS.preconditions=[];lS.procedureexamples=[];lS.references=[];lS.software=[];lS.status=b;lS.tactics=[F];lS.typecode=aD;lS.route="\u002Ftechniques\u002FFGT1642";lS.relatedObjects={bluf:oU,campaigns:[],criticalassets:[],detections:[],groups:[],mitigations:[],platforms:Qe,postconditions:[],preconditions:[],procedureexamples:[],references:[],software:[],status:b,tactics:[G],typecode:aD,subtechniques:[hP,fc,hQ]};lT.addendums=[{"access-required":l,campaigns:[],criticalassets:[{description:Qi,name:pR}],detections:[{component:vP,detects:Qj,fgdsid:vQ,name:jY}],groups:[],mitigations:[{fgmid:$,mitigates:Qk,name:aa}],name:"## Addendum Name: Fronthaul User Plane Data\r\n### Architecture Segments: O-RAN\r\n Adversary manipulates User Plane data on Open Fronthaul interface between O-DU and O-RU to re-direct the data to a wrong destination or get discarded by the recipient due to incorrect message parameters.\r\n\r\nThe O-RAN open fronthaul interface needs to implement strict performance requirements which include very high throughput and very low latency (clause 4.4 of [2]). Confidentiality and integrity protection requirements are not specified by O-RAN Alliance for control, user and synchronization (CUS) planes, and those are mandatory for M plane. See clause 6.1 of [2] and clause 5.4 of [3]. Also, 3GPP has defined algorithms for user plane data integrity protection. Many MNOs do not use those algorithms to reduce processing delay.

The open fronthaul interface makes it possible to distribute the physical layer functionalities between RU and DU, and to control RU operations from DU. O-RAN Alliance has selected a specific configuration (split 7.2x) for splitting the physical layer among those proposed by 3GPP. The lower part of the physical layer (low PHY) resides in RU and performs Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) phase compensation, inverse FFT and Cyclic Prefix (CP) insertion for frequency-to-time conversion in downlink, and FFT and CP removal in uplink. The physical layer in DU (high PHY) performs scrambling, modulation, layer mapping, and resource element mapping. Open fronthaul consists of four types of interfaces: Control or C plane is used to carry control plane messages for the RAN such as beamforming and scheduling commands. User or U plane is used to carry user plane data which includes IQ data (contains UE's CP & UP data) in FFT frequency domain for both DL & UL directions.

Vulnerabilities can exist in software due to unsecure coding practices that can lead to unanticipated behavior. Adversaries can take advantage of certain vulnerabilities through targeted exploitation for the purpose of arbitrary code execution. Oftentimes the most valuable exploits to an offensive toolkit are those that can be used to obtain code execution on a remote system because they can be used to gain access to that system. Users will expect to see files related to the applications they commonly used to do work, so they are a useful target for exploit research and development because of their high utility. Several types exist: ### Browser-based Exploitation Web browsers are a common target through [Drive-by Compromise](https:\u002F\u002Fattack.mitre.org\u002Ftechniques\u002FT1189) and [Spearphishing Link](https:\u002F\u002Fattack.mitre.org\u002Ftechniques\u002FT1566\u002F002). Endpoint systems may be compromised through normal web browsing or from certain users being targeted by links in spearphishing emails to adversary controlled sites used to exploit the web browser. These often do not require an action by the user for the exploit to be executed. ### Office Applications Common office and productivity applications such as Microsoft Office are also targeted through [Phishing](https:\u002F\u002Fattack.mitre.org\u002Ftechniques\u002FT1566). Malicious files will be transmitted directly as attachments or through links to download them. These require the user to open the document or file for the exploit to run. ### Common Third-party Applications Other applications that are commonly seen or are part of the software deployed in a target network may also be used for exploitation. Applications such as Adobe Reader and Flash, which are common in enterprise environments, have been routinely targeted by adversaries attempting to gain access to systems. Depending on the software and nature of the vulnerability, some may be exploited in the browser or require the user to open a file. For instance, some Flash exploits have been delivered as objects within Microsoft Office documents.[To read more, please see the MITRE ATT&CK page for this technique](https:\u002F\u002Fattack.mitre.org\u002Ftechniques\u002FT1203)";oi.detections=[];oi.groups=[];oi.id=th;oi.mitigations=[];oi.name="Exploitation for Client Execution";oi["object-type"]=c;oi.platforms=Fu;oi.postconditions=[];oi.preconditions=[];oi.procedureexamples=[];oi.references=[];oi.software=[];oi.status=b;oi.tactics=[dc];oi.typecode=aD;oi.route="\u002Ftechniques\u002FFGT1203";oi.relatedObjects={bluf:Ft,campaigns:[],criticalassets:[],detections:[],groups:[],mitigations:[],platforms:Fu,postconditions:[],preconditions:[],procedureexamples:[],references:[],software:[],status:b,tactics:[dd],typecode:aD,subtechniques:[lp,ee]};oj.description="Use capabilities to detect and block conditions that may lead to or be indicative of a software exploit occurring";oj.id=g$;oj.name=ha;oj["object-type"]=h;oj.techniques=[gD,Fw,gA];oj.route="\u002Fmitigations\u002FFGM1050";oj.relatedObjects={techniques:[eK,lp,eU]};os["component-of"]=[];os.description="A non-volatile data storage device (hard drive, floppy disk, USB flash drive) with at least one formatted partition, typically mounted to the file system and\u002For assigned a drive letter";os.id=or;os.name=FS;os["object-type"]=d;os.techniques=[];os.route="\u002Fdata sources\u002FFGDS0016";os.relatedObjects={"component-of":[],techniques:[],"data source":[tl,FZ,F_]};ou.bluf=GE;ou.campaigns=[];ou.criticalassets=[];ou.description="Adversaries may breach or otherwise leverage organizations who have access to intended victims.
