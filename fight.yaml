    \ network interfaces are within 5G core and RAN, and between the RAN and the 5G\
    \ Core (e.g. N2, N3, N4, Xn). \r\n\r\n2.\tSBI network interfaces are between core\

    \ interfaces, including IPX, are between network operators (between SEPPs, or\

    \ Plane, User Plane\r\n Adversary with access to a non-Service Based Interface\
    \ (non-SBI) node or an SBI Network Function (NF), or a function on the roaming/interconnect\
    \ interfaces, may manipulate or spoof user plane and control plane traffic on\
    \ that interface without integrity protection, towards a DOS or other attacks\
    \ on the UE or a NF.\r\n\r\nThe following Network interfaces are in the scope\
    \ of this document.\r\n\r\n\u201CNon-SBI\u201D (non-Service Based Interface) network\
    \ interfaces are within 5G core and RAN, and between the RAN and the 5G Core (e.g.\
    \ N2, N3, N4, Xn). \r\n\r\nSBI network interfaces are between core NFs within\
    \ an operator network; they use REST APIs.\r\n\r\nRoaming and interconnect interfaces,\
    \ including IPX, are between network operators (between SEPPs (N32), or other\
    \ interworking functions like AMF/MME (N26) and between UPFs (N9)).\r\n\r\nUnlike\
    \ radio communications, operator RAN to core communications do not always employ\
    \ integrity protection as per stanards. If the gNB does not provide integrity\
    \ protection for control plane (CP) packets sent on the N2/Xn interface or does\
    \ not provide user plane (UP) integrity protection for user plane packets sent\
    \ on the N3/Xn interfaces, or UPF does not provide integrity protection for user\
    \ plane packets sent on the N9 interface, then data manipulation (alteration of\
    \ messages, insertion/spoofing of messages, or replay of legitimate signaling\
    \ messages) is possible. This may result in DOS. \r\n\r\nThe adversary with access\
    \ to the SBI links, for example, with control over a middlebox (not including\
    \ the Service Communication Proxy or SCP), may manipulate or inject spoofed signaling\
    \ messages if TLS integrity is not enabled or is using a weak algorithm.\r\n \r\
    \nIf an IPX disables JWS signature or uses a weak algorithm for JWS signature,\
    \ an AiTM may manipulate data over the N32 interface while a UE is roaming.\r\n\
    \r\nSimilarly, if the EPC interworking interface N26 for non-roaming is not integrity\
    \ protected, all subscriber signaling data may be manipulated by adversary. Refer\
    \ Clause 4.3.1 of [3].\r\n\r\n"

  description: " An adversary may query the Network Repository Function (NRF) to discover\
    \ restricted Network Function (NF) services to further target that NF. \r\n\r\n\
    All active NFs in an operator network are to be securely registered with the NRF.\
    \ Part of this registration information includes the type of NF, the particular\
    \ services it provides, IP addresses, etc. \r\n\r\nConsumer NFs query the NRF\
    \ for Producers NFs they need to interact with, but the NRF is expected to check\
    \ that the Consumer NF is authorized to discover such Producer NF. This type of\
    \ signaling to the NRF can be abused to identify and target the NF of interest.\
    \ The NRF is expected to check discovery request against senders profile, which\
    \ is prone to misconfiguration and thus might not protect the restricted NF services.\r\
    \n\r\nIn network slicing, the same principles of NRF apply, and the service discovery\
    \ is restricted per slice; however, NFs in one slice may have a legitimate need\
    \ to communicate with NFs in another slice. If NF discovery authorization for\
    \ a specific slice is not supported by the NRF, the NF instance in one slice can\
    \ discover NF instances belonging to other slices. For example, an NF in one slice\

    \n\r\nThe NSSAI is a slice identifier. It contains two elements: a slice service\
    \ type (four 3GPP defined values) and a Slice Differentiator (SD), which should\
    \ be unique within that type. Consumer NFs may need to access services of Producers\
