    \ traffic.  \r\n\r\n\r\n The following Network interfaces are in the scope of\
    \ this technique addendum:\r\n\r\n1.\t\u201CNon-SBI\u201D (non-Service Based Interface)\
    \ network interfaces are within 5G core and RAN, and between the RAN and the 5G\
    \ Core (e.g. N2, N3, N4, Xn). \r\n\r\n2.\tSBI network interfaces are between core\
    \ NFs within an operator network; they use REST APIs.\r\n\r\n3.\tRoaming and interconnect\
    \ interfaces, including IPX, are between network operators (between SEPPs, or\
    \ other interworking functions like AMF/MME (N26) and between UPFs (N9)).\r\n\r\
    \nAn adversary with access to the non-SBI interfaces not using encryption can\
    \ monitor traffic exchange and obtain UE information such as user identifiers,\
    \ serving network identifiers, and location info. \r\n\r\nThe adversary with access\
    \ to the SBI links, may eavesdrop signaling messages if TLS encryption is not\
    \ enabled. This leads to disclosure of UE authentication and authorization information,\
    \ and NF IP addresses and other topology information.\r\n\r\nThe adversary positioned\
    \ on an IPX node may collect data over the N32 interface while a UE is roaming,\
    \ if a SEPP has used encryption on some parts of the messages sent, or used a\
    \ weak cipher for JWE encryption. Similarly, an adversary positioned on a SEPP\
    \ can observe or easily decrypt signaling messages sent on the N32 interface.\r\
    \n\r\nSimilarly, if the EPC interworking interface N26 for non-roaming is not\
    \ encrypted, all subscriber signaling data may be exposed to adversary.\r\n\r\n\
    Adversary may also use compromised virtualized network elements to (vSwitch/vRouter,\

    \ flows and user/system data. In a virtualized environment access can be gained\

    \ Adversary with access to a non-Service Based Interface (non-SBI) node or an\

    \ may manipulate or spoof user plane and control plane traffic on that interface\
    \ without integrity protection, towards a DOS or other attacks on the UE or a\
    \ NF.\r\n\r\nThe following Network interfaces are in the scope of this document.\r\
    \n\r\n1. \u201CNon-SBI\u201D (non-Service Based Interface) network interfaces\
    \ are within 5G core and RAN, and between the RAN and the 5G Core (e.g. N2, N3,\
    \ N4, Xn). \r\n\r\n2. SBI network interfaces are between core NFs within an operator\
    \ network; they use REST APIs.\r\n\r\n3. Roaming and interconnect interfaces,\
    \ including IPX, are between network operators (between SEPPs (N32), between UPFs\
    \ (N9), or interworking functions like between AMF and MME (N26)).\r\n\r\nUnlike\
    \ radio communications, operator RAN to core communications do not always employ\
    \ integrity protection as per standards. If the gNB does not provide integrity\
    \ protection for control plane (CP) packets sent on the N2/Xn interface or does\
    \ not provide user plane (UP) integrity protection for user plane packets sent\
    \ on the N3/Xn interfaces, or UPF does not provide integrity protection for user\
    \ plane packets sent on the N9 interface, then data manipulation (alteration of\
    \ messages, insertion/spoofing of messages, or replay of legitimate signaling\
    \ messages) is possible. This may result in DOS. \r\n\r\nThe adversary with access\
    \ to the SBI links, for example, with control over a middlebox (not including\
    \ the Service Communication Proxy or SCP), may manipulate or inject spoofed signaling\
    \ messages if TLS integrity is not enabled or is using a weak algorithm.\r\n \r\
    \nIf an IPX disables JWS signature or uses a weak algorithm for JWS signature,\
    \ an AiTM may manipulate data over the N32 interface while a UE is roaming.\r\n\
    \r\nSimilarly, if the EPC interworking interface N26 for non-roaming is not integrity\
