  description: " An adversary may query the Network Repository Function (NRF) to discover\
    \ restricted Network Function (NF) services to further target that NF. \r\n\r\n\
    All active NFs in an operator network are to be securely registered with the NRF.\
    \ Part of this registration information includes the type of NF, the particular\
    \ services that NF provides, IP addresses, etc. \r\n\r\nConsumer NFs query the\
    \ NRF for Producers NFs they need to interact with, but the NRF is expected to\
    \ check that the Consumer NF is authorized to discover such Producer NFs. This\
    \ type of signaling to the NRF can be abused to identify and target one or more\
    \ NFs of interest. The NRF is expected to check discovery requests against the\
    \ sender\u2019s profile, but this is prone to misconfiguration and therefore might\
    \ not protect the restricted NF services.\r\n\r\nIn network slicing, the same\
    \ principles of NRFs apply, and service discovery is restricted per slice; however,\
    \ NFs in one slice may have a legitimate need to communicate with NFs in another\
    \ slice. If NF discovery authorization controls are not supported by the NRF,\
    \ the NF instance in one slice can discover NF instances belonging to other slices.\
    \ For example, an NF in one slice should not be inquiring about NFs in other slices,\
    \ unless it needs to communicate with them. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

    \ Control Plane, Roaming, Virtualization\r\n Adversaries may sniff network traffic\
    \ to capture information about 5G environment, control and user plane data including\
    \ authentication material, equipment identifiers.\r\n\r\nA compromise of network\
    \ function (NF) supporting Service based (SBI), Non-Service Based (non-SBI), Roaming\
    \ interfaces, and virtual network elements may allow an adversary to capture network\
    \ traffic.  \r\n\r\n\r\n The following Network interfaces are in the scope of\
    \ this technique addendum:\r\n\r\n1.\t\u201CNon-SBI\u201D (non-Service Based Interface)\
    \ network interfaces are within 5G core and RAN, and between the RAN and the 5G\
    \ Core (e.g. N2, N3, N4, Xn). \r\n\r\n2.\tSBI network interfaces are between core\
    \ NFs within an operator network; they use REST APIs.\r\n\r\n3.\tRoaming and interconnect\
    \ interfaces, including IPX, are between network operators (between SEPPs, or\
    \ other interworking functions like AMF/MME (N26) and between UPFs (N9)).\r\n\r\
    \nAn adversary with access to the non-SBI interfaces not using encryption can\
    \ monitor traffic exchange and obtain UE information such as user identifiers,\
    \ serving network identifiers, and location info. \r\n\r\nThe adversary with access\
    \ to the SBI links, may eavesdrop signaling messages if TLS encryption is not\
    \ enabled. This leads to disclosure of UE authentication and authorization information,\
    \ and NF IP addresses and other topology information.\r\n\r\nThe adversary positioned\
    \ on an IPX node may collect data over the N32 interface while a UE is roaming,\
    \ if a SEPP has used encryption on some parts of the messages sent, or used a\
    \ weak cipher for JWE encryption. Similarly, an adversary positioned on a SEPP\
    \ can observe or easily decrypt signaling messages sent on the N32 interface.\r\
    \n\r\nSimilarly, if the EPC interworking interface N26 for non-roaming is not\
    \ encrypted, all subscriber signaling data may be exposed to adversary.\r\n\r\n\
    Adversary may also use compromised virtualized network elements to (vSwitch/vRouter,\
    \ Virtual Firewalls) to span traffic to a sniffing port for access to traffic\
    \ flows and user/system data. In a virtualized environment access can be gained\
    \ much more easily as the servers making up a function are more likely to be physically\
    \ and virtually distributed and the SDN vSwitch would allow an adversary to fork\
    \ IP packets flowing between hosts remotely much more easily. Such forking is\
    \ very difficult to detect or prevent from within a 3GPP NF or VM, and adversaries\
    \ may be able to read data in transit. \r\n\r\nAn adversary may utilize these\
    \ observations for several follow-on techniques.\r\n\r\n"
  - "#### Addendum Name: Fronthaul\r\n##### Architecture Segments: User Plane, Control\
    \ Plane, Roaming, Virtualization\r\n Adversaries may sniff network traffic to\
    \ capture information about fronthaul user plane.\r\n\r\nORAN Alliance has defined\
    \ the open fronthaul interface which connects one O-DU to one or more O-RUs inside\
    \ the gNB. The fronthaul interface makes it possible to distribute the physical\
    \ layer functionalities between RU and DU, and to control RU operations from DU.\
    \ ORAN Alliance has selected a specific configuration (split 7.2x) for splitting\
    \ of the physical layer among those proposed by 3GPP. The lower part of the physical\
    \ layer (low PHY) resides in RU and performs Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing\
    \ (OFDM) phase compensation, inverse FFT and Cyclic Prefix (CP) insertion for\
    \ frequency-to-time conversion in downlink, and FFT and CP removal in uplink.\
    \ The physical layer in DU (high PHY) performs scrambling, modulation, layer mapping,\
    \ and resource element mapping. Fronthaul consists of four types of interfaces:\
    \ Control or C plane is used to carry control plane messages, User or U plane\
    \ is used to carry user plane data, Synchronization or S plane is used to carry\
    \ timing information and Management or M plane is used to carry management data.\r\
    \n\r\nO-RAN fronthaul interface needs to implement strict performance requirements\
    \ which includes very high throughput and very low latency. See clause 4.4 of\
    \ [2]. Some security features may not be implemented by MNOs to meet those requirements\
    \ and to reduce processing delay. Hence, Adversary on the Side (AoTS) attack on\
    \ open fronthaul interface is possible which results in passive eavesdropping\
    \ of U plane data. The adversary may use a simple sniffer device to monitor all\
    \ U plane communications which is normally not encrypted at lower 3 layers (RLC,\
    \ MAC and PHY). Confidentiality and integrity protection requirements are not\
    \ specified by ORAN alliance for control, user and synchronization (CUS) planes,\
    \ and those are mandatory for M plane. See clause 6.1 of [2] and clause 5.4 of\
    \ [3].\r\n\r\nNote: The user plane data in PDCP and above layers remains encrypted\
    \ on Fronthaul U plane and this eavesdrop attack will not impact any of those\
    \ data unless PDCP security is also broken by the adversary.\r\n\r\n"

      exchanged, and error messages received from the peer SEPP.  Observations on
      the N32f interface include cell ID and Physical Cell ID, SUPI, NF to NF signaling
      for a given victim UE. An adversary may utilize these observations for a number
      of follow-on techniques.
    Name: SEPP compromise
  - Description: 'Adversary launches AoTS attack on open fronthaul U plane data traffic
      by using a simple sniffer device. The fronthaul U plane data usually does not
      have encryption due to stringent performance requirements. Hence an eavesdrop
      attack is possible by a simple device.


      This attack can only eavesdrop on user plane data below PDCP layer. Any user
      plane data in PDCP and above layers are not impacted by this attack. See clause
      5.4.1.2, T-UPLANE-01 of [1], clause 6.1 of [2] and clause 5.4 of [3].'
    Name: Eavesdrop on U plane data on open fronthaul interface.

    \ OA&M, Virtualization, Network Slice\r\n An adversary may compromise network\
    \ separation controls to gain access to one or more of the 5G security zones or\
    \ networks.  \r\n\r\n5G is a system of systems and may be composed of several\
    \ network and security zones, as well as slices.  A compromise of controls placed\
    \ to maintain security zones or network segmentation based on IP networks, application\
    \ groups or slices may allow an adversary to gain unauthorized access to networks\
    \ or services. This may occur at a Core, RAN, Cloud or Slice boundary.\r\n\r\n\
    Once the adversary has infiltrated the internals of the network, it has ample\
    \ opportunities and a much broader attack surface to explore. The adversary can,\
    \ e.g., conduct privilege escalation and process injection for gaining administrative\
    \ rights, attempt password cracking of valid user accounts on the nodes, exploit\
    \ vulnerabilities in databases and file systems, and take advantage of improper\
    \ configurations of routers and switches.\r\n\r\nThe boundaries of a network and\
    \ its security zones can exist between various technologies, such as 4G and 5G,\
    \ or between different partners, such as private networks, mobile operators, or\
    \ Mobile Virtual Network Operators (MVNOs). These boundaries can also exist between\
    \ different network components, such as radio access, core, edge, and cloud, as\
    \ well as between national or international links and operator cores, and service\
    \ providers or operator cores.\r\nIn some cases, firewalls may be used to separate\
    \ these zones, such as SS7 protocol, Diameter protocol, 5G APIs, enhanced SCP\
    \ (Service Communication Proxy), IP (Internet Protocol), SIP (Session Initiation\
    \ Protocol), and GTP (GPRS Tunneling Protocols) firewalls. Alternatively, an interworking\
    \ function may be used to translate one protocol into another. However, it's important\
    \ to note that privileged access is not always necessary to bypass a firewall\
    \ or exploit an interworking function. Often, insufficient filtering may be the\
    \ cause, or the filtering may not be sufficiently deep.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    \ splitting the physical layer among those proposed by 3GPP. The lower part of\
    \ the physical layer (low PHY) resides in RU and performs Orthogonal Frequency\
    \ Division Multiplexing (OFDM) phase compensation, inverse FFT and Cyclic Prefix\
    \ (CP) insertion for frequency-to-time conversion in downlink, and FFT and CP\
    \ removal in uplink. The physical layer in DU (high PHY) performs scrambling,\
    \ modulation, layer mapping, and resource element mapping. Fronthaul consists\
    \ of four types of interfaces: Control or C plane is used to carry control plane\

  - Description: Both UE registration and other data communication with network will
      be impacted.
    Name: Both Control Plane (CP) and User Plane (UP) data are modified by AitM attack
  preconditions:
  - Description: Adversary must have physical access to open fronthaul network to
      collect data and then manipulate and replay the data.
    Name: Adversary has access to open fronthaul network.
  - Description: Adversary must have deployed a fake gNB and a fake UE which modify

  procedureexamples:
  - Description: 'Adversary launches AiTM attack on open fronthaul U plane data traffic
      by using a simple sniffer and replay device. The fronthaul U plane data usually
      does not have integrity protection due to stringent performance requirements.
      Hence a data manipulation attack is possible by a simple device. DoS attack
      can be done by manipulating RLC header with bogus data and those messages will
      get discarded by the recipient. Session redirection attack can be launched by
      changing the destination MAC address in the MAC header which will re-direct
      the packets to an adversary-controlled server.


      This attack can only manipulate user plane data below PDCP layer. Any user plane
      data in PDCP and above layers are not compromised by this attack. See clause

    \ malicious intent. If that assumption fails, malicious activity can take place.\r\
    \n \r\nThe gNB is the termination point for encryption and integrity protection,\

    \ and the User Plane Function (UPF) in 5G, Serving Gateway (SGW) in 4G. In 4G,\
    \ there is another GTP-U tunnel between SGW and Packet Data Network (PDN) Gateway\
    \ (PGW). The GTP-U protocol header has a Tunnel Endpoint ID (TEID). Each UE is\
    \ assigned a unique TEID for the GTP-U tunnel and it is used to carry data from\
    \ multiple QoS flows. In order to apply additional techniques like hijacking the\
    \ tunnel, the adversary needs to discover a valid TEID.\r\n\r\nAdversary may try\
    \ to guess the TEID by sending a large number of encapsulated GTP-U packets to\
    \ the UPF/PGW from the internet with different TEIDs, until a valid one is found.\
    \ UPF/PGW forwards those packets to the UE through GTP-U tunnels. Following GTP-U\
    \ tunnels are used: In 5G, N3 GTP-U tunnel between UPF and gNB, in 4G, S1-U GTP-U\
    \ tunnel between SGW and eNB and S5 GTP-U tunnel between SGW and PGW. When target\
    \ IP address and TEID match, the adversary may receive a response indicating success.\
    \ Some core networks show affinity to certain ranges of TEIDs under certain conditions,\
    \ making brute forcing easier. Once TEID is known, further attacks can be launched\
    \ to slow down or crash the targeted UE.\r\n\r\n"

    \ TMSI is used but not changed frequently. This is a choice of the mobile network\
    \ operator. \r\n\r\n\r\nAn adversary can send silent SMS messages to that target\
    \ phone number, and watch the paging messages that the base station in that area\
    \ sends in response (assumes the target UE is in inactive mode and is located\
    \ in the area of a base station where the adversary has installed a radio interface\
    \ sniffer). From the sniffed paging messages, and adversary learns the \u201C\
    paging occasion\u201D for that UE. From the paging occasion, several bits (7)\
    \ of the IMSI can be deduced. The rest of the IMSI (24 bits) can be tried out\

    \ (e.g. by sending a given number of silent SMS and watching for a similar number\
    \ of paging messages), the adversary can determine the paging occasion for that\

      to manipulate legitimate signaling on the radio interface
  - Description: Adversary develops or obtains a tool to send silent SMS (e.g. mobile
      phone with special application running)
    Name: Obtain a silent SMS tool
  procedureexamples:
  - Description: "Adversary sends fake paging message with UEs temporary identifier\
      \ from a false base station. Sigover attack method is used to overshadow the\
      \ paging message from legitimate base station. If the victim UE is in the area,\
      \ it responds with a service request message. UE\u2019s presence in the cell\
      \ area is then known to the adversary [1]."
    Name: Send fake paging message to target UE
  - Description: "Adversary sends a series of silent SMS messages or makes a series\
      \ of silent calls to a target UE, that would cause the base station to send\
      \ a series of corresponding paging messages. The adversary then monitors the\
      \ paging channel to watch for these set of multiple paging messages, and thus\
      \ determines the paging slots (\u201Cpaging occasion\u201D) assigned to the\
      \ target UE. In addition, if the target UE responds, adversary concludes the\
      \ target is in the area of that base station. If not, the target is not there\
      \ [3]"
    Name: Send silent SMS to target UE
  - Description: "Adversary sends multiple silent SMS to the UE, and then watches\
      \ the paging channel. If multiple instances of the same GUTI is seen, or if\
      \ a given Paging Frame Index (determined by the IMSI) (PFI)  seems to be \u201C\
      busy\u201D then the adversary can conclude that the target UE is in that cell\
